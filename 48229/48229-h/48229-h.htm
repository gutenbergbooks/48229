<h2><a name="AUTHORS_PREFACE" id="AUTHORS_PREFACE">AUTHOR'S PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>This volume contains an ensemble of true episodes
about the French <i>poilu</i> taken from my diary.</p>

<p>The reader will regret, perhaps, the absence
of continuity in the following chapters; that will rapidly
disappear, however, when he sees the characteristic
figures he should better know and love for a long time
to come. A scruple has always guided me: to write the
truth. I have been strict in writing nothing but what I
have seen or heard.</p>

<p>In giving these souvenirs to the American public, I
have had but one object: to mold in relief the warlike
virtues of the admirable soldiers of France with whom
I have fought for more than three years.</p>

<p>Mothers, wives, sweethearts and children of the
heroes fallen in defense of their country, will find in
these pages a precious consolation: they will see that
with just reason they can be proud of their cherished
dead.</p>

<p>I ask indulgence, much indulgence of the public. I
have written these lines simply and faithfully during a
long and painful convalescence; many times I have felt
that my physical forces would abandon me before I
could arrive at the end of my task. I shall be fully
recompensed for these efforts if I know I have brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
to my readers the emotion and feeling, which I still
experience, of those epic hours.</p>

<h2><a name="TRANSLATORS_INTRODUCTION" id="TRANSLATORS_INTRODUCTION">TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<p>To have known the author intimately is a rare
privilege which has materially aided me in retaining,
if I have been successful in so doing,
the spirit and atmosphere of the original pages of "A
Blue Devil of France."</p>

<p>In every sense of the word I am a literalist. Barring
a very few instances I have been particularly rigid
in my efforts to render a literal translation. Where
it has been impossible to do this, the reader will find
the original French to enhance the charm and simplicity
of the stories.</p>

<p>Simultaneously this striking story of the great war
is published in Paris under the title of <i>Comme Ils
Vivent et Comme Ils Meurent</i> (How They Live and
Die).</p>

<p>Redundant with vitality the several stories show a
beautiful insight into the character of the French <i>poilu</i>,
who, fighting for more than four years, remains unbroken
in morale. Unpremeditatedly heroic, killing
their adversaries clean, ever chivalrous, witty, smiling
in the face of death and obscurity, these soldiers of
France will go down in history as martyrs to a definite
understanding between peoples.</p>

<p>Sordid as war may be, here is the glorious side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
<i>Le Feu</i>, by Henri Barbusse, the critics write, is pessimistic
and deals with the dark side of this momentous
conflict. If that be true "A Blue Devil of France,"
with winning ingenuity, tells us in a simple, straightforward
manner that there is another, nobler, majestic
view of modern battle. It personifies the spirit of
right, forever unquenchable, the champion over material
forces seeking to destroy.</p>

<p>Students of every free country will find in this book
numerous examples of the spirit of sacrifice of those
who, for four years, have written history with their
blood; they will see that the most beautiful existence
for a man is to know well how to live and die for his
country!</p>

<p>Americans may here visualize the Argonne, Verdun,
Saint Mihiel, the Champagne, consecrated spots, where
their own blood is now being hypothecated to succeeding
generations. They may see the type of the French
<i>poilu</i>, with whom our boys are fighting arm in arm,
as they go plunging on to certain victory.</p>

of the retreat.</i></p>

<p><i>From the month of December, 1914, he became attached
to the French Army. He was commissioned
sub-lieutenant, January, 1915.</i></p>

<p><i>The greater part of the stories in this chapter occurred
during the period between March 7, 1915 and
July of the same year, during which time he fought
in the sector held by the Marine Fusiliers and that of
the Zouaves in the region of Nieuport.</i></p>

<p>I feel I must leave all, family, home, position.</p>

<p>I clasp my wife and three little ones in my
arms.... The iron gate closes behind me and I almost
break into tears&mdash;the happiest moments of my
life are ended and I go toward the UNKNOWN&mdash;&mdash;</p>

MY ENLISTMENT, ANTWERP.<br />
<i>August</i> 6, 1914.<br />
</div>

<p>Already I curse war. I have journeyed seventy-two
hours on the railroad to enlist as a soldier.</p>

<p>The recruiting officer in charge said to me when I
faced him:</p>

<p>"Ha! another. This is a double invasion, the German
invasion and that of the volunteers!"</p>

THE OLD MAN AND THE GOAT, ANTWERP.<br />
<i>August</i> 14, 1914.<br />
</div>

<p>All morning there is an uninterrupted cortège of
civilians fleeing from the onrushing hordes. They have
taken with them everything capable of being carried in
their hands. The pathetic sight makes one feel the
precipitateness of the flight, the despair, the panic!</p>

<p>A bent old man arrives presently; he walks slowly,
fixedly regarding the ground. He is leading a little
white goat, which, every ten paces or so, butts the
old man with its horns, as if urging him to go faster.
The latter does not falter&mdash;he walks straight ahead.</p>

<p>One doesn't know whether to laugh or weep.</p>


<div class="right">
THE SOLDIER WHO BAYONETS HIS<br />
FIRST BOCHE, BELGIUM.<br />
<i>September</i>, 1914.<br />
</div>

<p>A young soldier was seated alongside the road. He
belonged to a Regiment of the Division quartered in
the neighboring villages. He had a sad and dejected
air.</p>

<p>I seated myself at his side because I wanted to know
the impression of the men who had already been in
battle.</p>

<p>"Have you been under fire?" I queried.</p>

<p>"Yes, corporal."</p>

<p>"How many Germans have you killed?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>I saw a haze of anger pass over the eyes of this
young chap who regarded me with a fixed look.</p>

<p>"Just one! I hate the Germans, I swear it, but I
tremble to think what I have done&mdash;yes, I killed him
dead enough!</p>

<p>"<i>Voilà!</i> I am a gardener by trade. I live in the
Luxembourg. The garden of my masters&mdash;it is all
my life. Why has this accursed war broken out? Can
they no longer stay at home, the pigs?</p>

<p>"Then I was called and you know the rest, because
I will not speak of the first days of the campaign.</p>

<p>"But, <i>voilà!</i> one night we made an ambuscade on
a farm in the outskirts of Vilvorde. It was dark. They
told us the Germans would possibly attempt a reconnaissance
in the village and it was necessary to open
their eyes.</p>

<p>"We were placed in a house closer to the enemy lines
than the others and it was forbidden to enter the street.
Some of my comrades were hidden above on the second
floor, but I was hiding back of the front stairs and
observed the entrance-way.</p>

<p>"My nerves were overexcited by this long wait. A
single ray of the moon wandered over the ground above
the gate; it recalled one of my ambushes for flower
poachers.</p>

<p>"Night advanced and finally I believed they would
never come. Suddenly a well-sustained fire broke out
a short distance away. I had fixed my bayonet and
now grasped my rifle tightly.</p>

<p>"The gate opened brusquely. The night was clear
and I saw a big devil of a German officer, revolver in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
hand, pass through and enter the walk. He desired
without doubt to seek shelter, for he slammed the gate
after him.</p>

<p>"This is what passed then in a flash. I left my
hiding place&mdash;he saw me. In his eyes there was the
look of distress one always sees in those of a trapped
beast. He shot at me, but so quickly that he did not
aim. The report awoke the whole house.</p>

<p>"Already I had jumped at him&mdash;and I literally nailed
him to the gate.</p>

<p>"Ah! To feel the crushing of bones&mdash;when one is
accustomed to cultivate flowers&mdash;to feel the crushing of
bones!"</p>


<div class="right">
BRITISH STOLIDITY, BELGIUM.<br />

</div>

<p>War? At the beginning no one knew then what it
was. The enemy bombarded us with shells of an
enormous caliber, which excited, more than anything
else, our curiosity.</p>

<p>Two "Tommies" started to swim across the river
Nèthe to where the enemy had but recently been thrown
back. They repeated to everyone who asked them
where they were going:</p>

<p>"We want to see the BIG cannon, yes the BIG
cannon!"</p>

THE PRISONERS OF<br />
GENERAL DE MAUD'HUY, NEAR ARRAS.<br />
<i>January</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>Upon leaving table one day with General de
Maud'huy, we came upon a group of German prisoners,
who immediately looked at us, saluting respectfully.</p>

<p>"These are 'my prisoners,'" the general told me,
"they work in the cantonment."</p>

<p>"I had at the beginning about a dozen boches and
mustered them every night because we were only ten
miles from the line of fire."</p>

<p>"Several escaped?" I asked.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," he replied. "The second night
we counted eleven, the third, fifteen. Now there are
fifty. We never knew where they came from!"</p>

<p>"I have enough boches. I mustered them all yesterday
and told them that if their number kept on increasing
I would send them all back. You will agree
that it is impossible to keep a strict count under these
conditions!"</p>


<div class="right">
THE ADMIRAL, NIEUPORT.<br />
<i>March</i> 7, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>I saw Admiral Ronarc'h for the first time to-day.</p>

<p>All morning the city of Nieuport was bombarded
with shells of a very large caliber, crushing and enveloping
the poor little Flemish homes in great clouds
of brick-dust and smoke. The ground trembled. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Marine Fusiliers<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> must have paid them back in full,
for they returned a heavy fire from the large guns of
the fortress.</p>

<p>I arrived at Nieuport-Baths along the river Yser
with Captain Ricard, who said to me:</p>

<p>"With all that racket, to-day, we are sure to find
the Admiral and Commandant Delage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At the moment we reached the locks we were well
serenaded&mdash;the shells literally rained around us. At
regular intervals the larger ones burst in the city. Abject
ruins&mdash;I no longer recognized this once lively little
city which I visited during my childhood, dead and
deserted to-day!</p>

<p>Finally we came, about four o'clock, to the admiral's
shelter, where we found him, with Commandant Delage
and the chaplain.</p>

<p>I was received with smiles and hearty handshakes;
on similar days one is always sure to be received by
the admiral in a most charming manner.</p>

<p>"Lucky chap," he said, "well have you chosen the
day of your first visit to Nieuport. What a bombardment,
hey! fortunately all goes well, practically no
losses&mdash;that right, Delage?"</p>

<p>Commandant Delage smiled all over.</p>

<p>"Yes, admiral."</p>

<p>At that moment a shell burst so close that pictures
were torn from the walls and a chair was turned upside
down. A cloud of dust spouted through the ventilating
shaft&mdash;at the same time we heard a rumbling
of falling walls, the clattering of splintered glass and
broken tiling falling on the ground.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p>We had, for our protection, an arch made of half-thicknesses
of bricks. If we must be struck, then we
should have, at least, the opportunity of not suffering
very long!</p>

<p>Each told his story, tales of the sea and of the
war&mdash;then&mdash;that was not all, there was a programme
of work to accomplish, and we at once set about the
task.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Toward nightfall, I left the shelter or cave, which
I shall never forget. The shell which shook us fell in
the courtyard of a house, scooping out a funnel-shaped
crater thirty feet in diameter. A Marine discovered
the base of the projectile: a 420!<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

A TELEGRAM FROM ATTILA, NIEUPORT-BATHS.<br />
<i>March</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>Returning from the Great Dune after several days,
Captain Perroud and myself stop before the old
Nieuport-Baths' station. It is in a pretty state. We
enter the ruins and have penetrated as far as the office
of the Passenger Agent, all in a tumult, papers scattered
everywhere&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Sealed telegrams are seen on the floor, and, it is
strange, they have not excited the curiosity of the
plunderers, for these latter would have found some
fastidious reading. I confess, what concerned me was
the desire to open some of them to see what persons
could have said at the moment of evacuating Nieuport-Baths.</p>

<p>The first was addressed to an English woman, "Mrs.
Smith, Regina Hotel, Nieuport-Baths." It said:
"Things are beginning to get worse where you are.
Nevertheless, do whatever you think best. Smith."</p>

<p>I opened the second telegram:</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Y&mdash;&mdash;, Regina Hotel, Nieuport-Baths."
It was dated Ostend, October, 1914, and
read: "Here there is absolute safety. Come at once.
Many kisses! Attila."</p>

<p>Among all this tragedy and desolation here, above
all, was the final comedy. I folded the telegram and
placed it in my pocket.</p>

<p>Some weeks later I was dining in Paris at the home
of Madame L&mdash;&mdash;, wife of a professor in the <i>Conservatoire</i>;
I had as my dinner partner the great <i>artiste</i>,
Suzanne Desprès.</p>

<p>After having told a thousand details of our life in
the trenches, some frightful enough, others sad, the
moment had arrived to inject a note of gaiety into
the sombre tableau which I had sketched for them&mdash;I
drew forth Attila's telegram.</p>

<p>A cry escaped my partner. "Mlle. Y&mdash;&mdash;, she was
one of my company in the Théâtre de l'&OElig;uvre!"</p>

<p>"And Attila?"</p>

<p>"He is the Director of the Théâtre des Galeries St.
Hubert, in Brussels and well known in Paris!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Attila's telegram has been safely delivered to Mlle.
Y&mdash;&mdash;, who, this time, will not complain of the remissness
of the telegraph company, but perhaps, of her
own indiscretion.</p>

<p>The Marines have found a way to divert German
rifle fire from our loopholes in the trenches.</p>

<p>They have tied a number of empty sardine cans
on the ends of sticks and fixed the latter firmly in the
parapet, at which the boches shoot continually.</p>

<p>Since then "Fritz" spends his spare time in trying
to knock them down; our losses have perceptibly
diminished.</p>

<p>Less than a mile from the enemy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Rifle balls whistle to-night through the streets
oftener than usual; there is a certain amount of nervousness
in the sector.</p>

<p>But these wandering bullets will not thwart the

Zouaves: a masked ball in the Casino!</p>

<p>We found plenty of odd and strange bits of apparel
among the ruined villas; and our masked ball took on
an odd appearance with the extraordinary costumes.
The <i>toubib</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> clipped his flowing mustaches and wore
a lady's gown&mdash;he was good to look at! Young and
fair, as he is, one had to regard him closely not to
be deceived. Major Peigné was naturally taken for a
"chicken" and there was much rivalry for a few moments,
I swear it!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Degove with his old straw hat and battered valise
was a scream, while Ricard, in his uniform of a Belgian
officer of the First Empire, was absolutely funny&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>We are going to install an electrical machine on
the right bank of the river Yser. My men are bringing
the heavy box in which it was transported. With its

tired. The first rays of the spring sun have not come

the air of carrying a funeral urn.</p>

<p>"Hey," I shouted, addressing them, "what would you
say if you had a beautiful Parisian Princess in that
box?"</p>

<p>"What would I say," returned an old corporal, "what

A CORPSE BETWEEN THE LINES, THE GREAT DUNE.<br />
<i>May</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>While returning from a night reconnaissance between
the lines one of our Zouaves had been killed; his body
lay for several days in the sand about forty feet from
our first line.</p>

<p>His corporal, a very brave Alsatian, could not look
over the parapet without noticing his comrade's body
did not shrink fast enough. Morning and night he was
seen very pensive, talking to himself, irritable with the
men&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then one day when it was quiet, at full noon, he
was seen to leave the trench, a shovel in one hand and
a wooden cross in the other. Everyone, breathless, saw
him advance slowly, calmly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>At first the Germans fired at him several times, missing
him, notwithstanding the fact they were only about
ninety feet away. Then they ceased firing to see, no
doubt, what this fool was going to do!</p>

<p>He stopped close to the Zouave's body placed his
cross on the sand and staidly began to dig a grave&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>When he judged it to be deep enough he put the
rigid body of his comrade in and began covering him
with great shovelfuls of sand. Then he smoothed the
tomb, planted the cross and adjusted the red badge
of death&mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>In an impressive moment of silence&mdash;for both sides
looked on without losing a single movement&mdash;they saw
him advance to the head of the knoll, his face to the
cross, click his heels and give the military salute&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p>He came back slowly to our lines and jumped briskly
into the trench. Immediately he began to pace up and
down before his squad back of the parapet, with fixed
bayonet, facing the grave his hands had dug.</p>

<p>"Stand at ease!" said he, "listen carefully. My
men who fall will not lack a burial nor will they lie
in the open air like rotting dogs. Break!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fifteen days later a German bullet struck him in
the head back of a loophole. He was killed instantly.
His comrades interred him in the Zouave cemetery at
Nieuport-Baths. They wrote his name on a piece of
paper, which they rolled up and placed in a bottle&mdash;&mdash;</p>


<div class="right">
THE DEATH OF THE TERRITORIAL, NIEUPORT.<br />
<i>May</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>It has rained all day. Toward nightfall only did
rain cease to fall. The sky is gray and heavy, but
the air is fresh. The Marines in their dripping oilskins
walk to and fro in the trench. The air is so
clear that we can see, over there on the horizon, the
silhouette of Bruges, with its old houses and high
towers.</p>

<p>"It is sad to see you so mirage-like and far away,
oh! Bruges the captive, brave city, in all your history
you have thirsted for liberty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Two hours pass and it is time to rejoin my comrades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
at the cantonment. But I turn again and again to
review the panorama before me.</p>

<p>I come at last to Nieuport. As I enter the principal
street, I see going ahead a brave Territorial, who also
returns to the cantonment unshaven and unkempt after
his long vigil in the trenches. He is completely equipped
with all his personal belongings, but is in no hurry.
This brave man is leaving the front for good because
he is the father of five children. He precedes me some
thirty paces and I hasten to catch up with him.</p>

<p>We arrive at the top of the Casino, when, suddenly,
a whistling announces the arrival of a shell&mdash;explosion,
smoke&mdash;a jagged piece of metal strikes him in the head
and I see the man fall in front of me.</p>

<p>The acrid smoke gags me, but I am quickly at his
side. He is dead: fractured skull&mdash;his face purple&mdash;mouth
open&mdash;his brains strewn on the pavement&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night while I am at dinner with my comrades,
an orderly comes to say that there is someone outside
who wishes to speak with me. In the darkened passageway
I scarcely recognize the chaplain of the 16th Territorials,
a man very simple and good.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant, you know, without doubt, that we have
had one of our men killed but a short while ago. We
are going to bury him at sunrise. Unfortunately we
have no one to play the organ&mdash;Figon is in the trenches&mdash;you
will be very kind to play something for us."</p>

<p>"Good; you can count on me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All night long the sight of distant Bruges and the
death of the poor Territorial haunt me. I am seated
before the piano in our "Villa" where we have installed
our entire <i>ménage</i>.</p>

<p>I begin to improvise a melody, sweet and infinitely
sad and the theme recurs again and again, developing
into a funeral chant&mdash;yes, very soon I will play that
for him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Toward dawn a man comes to find me. It is very
calm outside and the sector has a sleepy air.</p>

<p>I enter the church where can be seen large breaches
in the walls and roof. A coffin hastily constructed,
and covered with the Tricolor, red, white and blue, is
in the choir, resting on two wooden supports. The
organ is at its side, so close, so close, that I see the
man's blood, which flows drop by drop, through the
boards of the rudely built coffin&mdash;a brilliant red spot
glistens on the white flagstone.</p>

<p>A few men of the 16th and some stretcher-bearers
are kneeling in the nave; others arrive one by one,
helmet in hand, without noise&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Scarcely had the service commenced and the priest
begun his chant for the dead, than German and French
shells screaming, pass over the church, as if they were
searching for each other in the air. The shots progressed
angrily, followed by their plaintive mewing.</p>

<p>At the offertory, I played the sad melody on the
organ I had improvised during the night. I put all
my heart and emotion into it. But soon everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
seemed to grow dark within me&mdash;saw in the distance
the towers of Bruges and, close, a coffin and a sheet
of blood&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Dies irae, Dies illa</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>


<div class="right">
ON PATROL BEFORE ST. GEORGES.<br />
<i>May</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>Before starting out I have taken my automatic pistol
out of its scabbard and slipped it in my pocket.</p>

<p>I must go to the other side of the canal to the
farm of the "Dead Cow." An ensign from the cruiser
X&mdash;&mdash; accompanies me with a dozen or so men.</p>

<p>Two of my sappers go along to aid the installation
over there of an infernal machine. As German patrols
reconnoiter the farm it will be a good turn at their
game&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>As darkness falls we tumble into a boat and cross
the evacuation canal. All this is done with marked
silence. We creep along revolver in hand. There is
no one in the ruins of the farm. The patrol spreads
itself around us, and during this interval, with my two
<i>poilus</i>, I install the snare for the boches!</p>

<p>The work ended, we fall silently back.</p>

<p>Not a shot!</p>

<p>We have returned to our lines without an incident!</p>

LADY DOROTHY, THE GREAT DUNE.<br />
<i>May</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>We are at table. Major Peigné presides at breakfast
of the officers of the 19th Company, 2nd Battalion.
The subjects of conversation which recur each
day in a sappers' kitchen have been exhausted: progress
of work along the sector, effect of the last bombardment,
news of the absent ones, criticism of work accomplished
by the soldiers, next <i>permissions</i>;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> then
we take up the eternal question, the only one which
counts, assuredly, woman.</p>

<p>There have been many weeks in which not a one of
us has seen a woman's petticoat, not a one, I swear it!</p>

<p>To be in this cursed city of Nieuport is not an enviable
"visit at the seashore"&mdash;the enemy systematically
persists in destroying it: the Casino, the villas and
the approaches to the pier are completely torn to
pieces. Can you imagine a woman in such a place?</p>

<p>Stories of woman, adventures of woman, anecdotes
of woman, serve as topics of conversations. "When
you haven't the object of your desires," said a profound
philosopher, "you speak of it."</p>

<p>The conversation became general again, when, all at
once, Lieutenant Divisia silenced us with a finger before
him. No, it was impossible to be deceived, my
word upon it, a woman's voice was heard in the next
room!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<p>Had a 420 fallen in the midst of us, the silence could
not have been more impressive&mdash;of course realizing that
it would have flattened us like pancakes. But, quickly
and with remarkable unison, we arose quietly with the
same intention&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Yet, with an energetic gesture, Major Peigné, who
never lost a bet, stopped us and made for the door.</p>

<p>"Remain here," he said, "I will see what it is!" He
entered the room at the side, nimbly closing the door
after him. It was very malicious! We looked at each
other with stupor and regret. Then we cautiously approached
the crack in the boards that separated the
two spaces. It was, in effect, a woman, a young woman
deliciously beautiful, I assure you&mdash;an indelible vision
in this terrible, stricken little city. Lady Dorothy,
with her pretty khaki costume, appeared before us for
the first time! She had the air of a warlike Amazon
which became her perfectly, and, at first sight, we all
had fallen in love with her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She was engaged in a lengthy conversation with our
corporal-secretary to whom she had been sent to do
her bit among the soldiers, all unknown to us.</p>

<p>We all thought: "Little Lady Dorothy, the gold
of your blonde hair which we see through the slit in
the partition is as precious a bit as that you are offering
to our corporal&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>After that we saw several times the fugitive vision
of this angel with the blonde locks searching among the
ruins for our wounded. She drove her own automobile
with a steady hand, with enemy shells breaking around
her, vainly seeking to blow her to bits.</p>

THE CONSCIENTIOUS POILU, BEFORE ST. GEORGES.<br />
<i>May</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>The nights are still very cold and to warm ourselves
we have builded a comfortable fire by the sea. Sacks
of sand, skillfully fixed by Richard, mask the flashes
from the brazier, for otherwise they would certainly
invite 77's and 105's which the enemy would not lose
time dropping among us to disturb our momentary
comfort in the first line.</p>

<p>Reymond and I have many things to discuss and
the hours pass relatively fast; the Marine Fusiliers
come and go in the trenches and communicating lines
with a sort of nervous activity that never leaves them
night or day, a trait found only in men that follow
the sea.</p>

<p>The sector is extremely calm, the tide has gone out
a bit and Reymond has sent a patrol to the other
side of the evacuation canal.</p>

<p>Soon the <i>poilu</i> in charge of the patrol returns and,
walking up to his superior, says:</p>

<p>"Captain, we have been out reconnoitering the
enemy; we saw a boche on sentinel duty; he did not
see us&mdash;I believe I can get him."</p>

<p>"How far is he?"</p>

<p>"About half a mile away."</p>

<p>"Go&mdash;get him!"</p>

<p>We continued the conversation as the <i>poilu</i> went on
his errand; it struck us that the man had been deceived.
As on a certain night they had charged on a blind,
about a hundred yards from here&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The night was passing without incident when soon
our brave chap returned and, assuming his former position
before his officer, said:</p>

<p>"Captain, I cannot get him&mdash;there is a network of
barbed wire. Can I kill him?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly. Always use your own judgment.
You don't usually have time to come back for instructions&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again he started out and the heavens began to pale;
we searched once more for images of the past in the
glowing embers of the wood fire which was fast dying
out.</p>

<p>Suddenly, over there, toward the German lines, a
rifle shot broke the stillness of the night, followed by
the well-known machine-gun serenade; immediately
rockets, star shell and the artillery came to life&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Reymond rises, standing very stiff and straight.</p>

<p>"Ah, hang it! The poor devil must be shot to
pieces&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Our own cannon begin to mix in the fray. Reymond
decides to send some men after the others. He is
visibly concerned about our soldiers and is on the verge
of going himself.</p>

<p>Just then the poilu stands before him for the third
time, saluting respectfully:</p>

<p>"Captain&mdash;I have killed him!"</p>

<p>And he said it with a kind of accent that made a
shiver run down the spine.</p>

<p>The sky commences to resolve itself into long yellow
and gray stripes&mdash;ah, Flanders!&mdash;ah, Flanders!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The Marine Fusiliers leave everywhere traces of
their <i>esprit</i>.</p>

<p>They have taken from a home, three-fourths demolished,
a little statue of the Virgin, former protectress
of the household.</p>

<p>Carrying it into the first-line trenches with them,
they have constructed a niche for the Virgin in the
sandbags.</p>

<p>With her open arms and sad air she seems to say
to them:</p>

<p>Some yards farther is found, a little back of the

fortunately unexploded, of the kind the boches have
been generously distributing among us with their "minnenwerfer"
for some time. A notice of warning says:</p>

Kuhn asked to lead the volunteers who came forward.</p>

<p>"Everything passed very well at the beginning, the
artillery preparation was perfect and at the given hour
they went at it lively. The sappers captured in the
mine twenty-two Germans, all very young, and an
officer. They passed them rapidly back and it was at
this moment enemy reaction was felt. Kuhn remained
the last&mdash;the mine blew up&mdash;we saw him totter and
fall on the parapet of the boche trench, among the
partially cut barbed wire. Whether he was killed by
the explosion of the mine or a German bullet no one
knows&mdash;we were forced back and it was very late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<p>"That night there was general consternation: his
men cried. A little sapper went out all by himself
to recover the body. He could not endure to see the
body of his lieutenant remain in the hands of the
enemy.</p>

<p>"Three times he tried to reach Kuhn's corpse in
spite of incessant enemy fire which remained on the
<i>qui-vive</i>.</p>

<p>"Finally, crouching, he came close enough to pass
a cord under the arms and started back, rolling the
circular wire entanglements in a manner you can very
well imagine.</p>

<p>"At last he cleared the body from the wire, but we
thought several times he would be the victim of his
own devotion.</p>

<p>"At sunrise all that remained of Kuhn was in our
lines. Captain Perroud came to see him and I accompanied
him. Our poor friend's body was literally riddled
with bullets, he was almost unrecognizable&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What are you going to say to his mother. He
was the only one left.</p>

<p>"He liked you very much and of course you will not
fail to write a few words to the poor woman.</p>

<p>"Come back soon&mdash;we miss you!</p>

AN EPISODE IN MINING WARFARE,<br />
MALANCOURT WOOD.<br />
<i>July</i> 7, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>We arrived yesterday afternoon toward dusk, in an
automobile, and in full view of the enemy.</p>

<p>General de Salins, who commanded the Brigade,
found us at this moment on the edge of the wood and
could not believe his eyes&mdash;Guéneau and I were bumping
along, making very slow progress on account of
the numerous shell-holes along the road made during
the last bombardment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<p>What a magnificent afternoon! At this time of the
year, Malancourt Wood is an exquisite sight. The
lengthening rays of the sun easily penetrate the green
foliage of the trees that completely surround us.</p>

<p>This sector had been active enough before, when the
enemy for the first time attacked with flame-throwers.
After that, save for the days when mines were exploded,
the wood became one of the most quiet spots on the
front.</p>

<p>We are heartily received by our sapper-comrades.</p>

<p>At night we all go together into the first-line trench,
where there are but few soldiers. It is very black
without. Not a rifle shot, not the sound of a cannon.
What a difference from the sector in Flanders!</p>

<p>We leave the trench and go over, crouching, into
No Man's Land, advancing with great precaution
through the tall grass. When a rocket flares from our
lines or those of the enemy, we flatten with our faces
to the ground and remain without the slightest movement.
Then we advance again, holding our breath.
Finally we arrive at the enemy's barbed wire entanglements
and hear them talking in their trenches.</p>

<p>I am close to Guéneau, who listens attentively while
I murmur in his ear:</p>

<p>"Old chap, yesterday at this time we were drinking
a whisky and soda on the boulevard."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We pass the night in a shelter placed at our disposal
by Major Jouanic. We must assist in the early morning
at the explosion of a mine under an enemy listening
post.</p>

<p>We choose our time and it is yet night when we
start out. Hardly awake, we look more like a hunting
party: nearly all the sappers preceding us in the communicating
trench are carrying clubs and might be
taken for beaters.</p>

<p>Arriving soon at the first line, each takes the place
that has been assigned. I look at my watch&mdash;the mine
will be exploded at four o'clock.</p>

<p>It is near the edge of the wood and I gaze into the
open stretch on my right. The sky is turning a deep
rose and the birds are singing, as they sing at the
break of a beautiful summer's day. All else is asleep
in our corner of the earth, and for us who know, this
silence is impressive&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Five minutes more&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I look in front of me. The mined spot is plainly
visible&mdash;I see the German trench and the barbed-wire
entanglement very well.</p>

<p>Farther to the right is the place where Guéneau
and I had crouched the night before; I see the tall,
yellow grass and the zig-zag path by which we had
returned.</p>

<p>Two minutes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>My eyes do not leave the spot, where, in a few moments,
human beings will be hurled in the air and disappear.
They are our enemies, but one experiences
that undefinable feeling that one is conscious of when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
looking at the guillotine about to fall before you. What
silence!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Suddenly an enormous gust of earth leaps into the
air&mdash;- One gapes with stupor&mdash;a heavy detonation&mdash;the
earth is transformed into a vast volcano and black
soil and stones are shot continually up!</p>

<p>Everything in the vicinity becomes animated and
three large trees begin to incline slowly in different
directions with sinister crackings&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>At the same moment I see very distinctly a German
soldier thrown high into space, his hands tightly clutching
his rifle. He turns over slowly and then his gun
goes off, having, without doubt, unconsciously pulled
the trigger.</p>

<p>Then it is this column of earth which falls showering
and covering us with a rain of stones and pebbles,
thumping the ground loudly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And then comes the waking of battle; the stupor is
over and a heavy fusillade breaks out along the whole
line; machine-guns sputter, and the artillery fire becomes
violent&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>We are so close to the enemy trench that we hear
the cries of the dying and wounded. The mine exploded
at a well-selected spot and the losses must be
heavy.</p>

<p>These cries are soon transformed into heart-rending
wails which portray the resulting terror and anguish,
cries of men who have been startled out of their sleep
to die.</p>

<p>Bullets whistle loudly and clip the earth around us&mdash;the
leaves, the new and pretty leaves of the wood,
flutter and fall in our midst like in the sad days of
autumn&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Quiet comes again. A big German officer has the
nerve to leap on the parapet of the trench very close
to us, and shout:</p>

<p>"Well done, Seventh Engineers!"</p>

<p>His attitude seemed to imply: "You are in no danger
now." He then jumps back quickly into his trench.</p>

<p>The wounded in due time are cared for and taken
back&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Work is finished for the day!</p>

THE MAGPIE "ANATOLE," MALANCOURT WOOD.<br />
<i>July</i> 8, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>"What a luncheon, major! It is too much&mdash;too
much, a thousand times too much. You dine well in
Malancourt Wood! Hors d'&oelig;uvres, roast chicken,
chops. What a remarkable chef!"</p>

<p>"I agree with you&mdash;he is the former chef of the
<i>Lysistrata</i>, the yacht belonging to Mr. James Gordon
Bennett, himself!"</p>

<p>So saying, Major Jouanic filled his goblet with
champagne to the brim. We are less than fifteen
minutes from the first line and the weather is marvelous&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dessert is ready, Ducoux, you can bring in Anatole."</p>

<p>Ducoux got up and left table. He came back
soon with Anatole on his finger, a young magpie who
already had the air of an old maid&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Anatole is not well brought up&mdash;she is a little noisy.
When one speaks to her of <i>Madame Colette</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> she gives
herself up to comic contortions, and what a sight!</p>

<p>She drinks greedily of champagne out of the guest's
glass and becomes shamefully drunk!</p>

<p>Now she staggers around the table, making insufferable
cries. She inclines her head, staring at us with
one eye&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You shame us, Anatole. Be quiet and let us hear
no more from you."</p>

<p>Anatole flutters over, seeking refuge on Ducoux's
shoulder, whom she likes best, and goes to sleep&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>We went this afternoon to see one of our friends,
a lieutenant of infantry, in the neighboring sector.</p>

<p>Bringing along a bottle of champagne, we drank
it with him at the listening post, twenty-five yards from
the enemy.</p>

<p>Naturally the empty bottle was hurled by a skillful
hand into the trench of our neighbors in front&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The reply was not long in coming: three 77's which,

did no damage.</p>

MOVING, NIEUPORT.<br />
<i>July</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>My <i>poilus</i> were disagreeably surprised this morning.
The proprietress of one of the villas
occupied by a certain number of my men
arrived at Nieuport this morning accompanied by a
Belgian gendarme. General Hély d'Oissel, commanding
the Division, had authorized the latter to make a search
for some wine she had left in the house.</p>

<p>This is what is extraordinary: it is true the wine
was there, but imagine and understand the despair
of the <i>poilus</i>&mdash;they did not suspect the existence of
the treasure! Some good <i>pinard</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> was placed in
a hole under the stairway, into which one descended
by means of a trap door, also skillfully camouflaged
by a morsel of linoleum.</p>

<p>And to think they had slept several months over
this precious <i>pinard</i> without knowing it!</p>

<p>Luckily the good woman's carriage could not enter
the city on account of the barricades, and other defense
works, so my good-natured <i>poilus</i> profited by it,
and aided her in moving. In this manner they saved
a few bottles, which probably would have been broken
by the jolting of the conveyance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<div class="right">
THE MAN CUT IN TWO, THE TRIANGULAR WOOD.<br />
<i>July</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>This cursed road is terribly torn up.</p>

<p>When one returns to the city of Nieuport by automobile
it is necessary to go at top speed along there.
The road is almost obliterated by shell-holes and the
bombs which fall there incessantly. One must "fly"
past the Triangular Wood.</p>

<p>This trip is impressive enough, because it is rare
that one is not circumvallated by falling shells. It is
very exciting!</p>

<p>One day when I was returning to Nieuport, the
bombardment was extremely violent. I was sitting
alongside the chauffeur. We had regulated our speed
with that of a motorcyclist who preceded us by two
hundred yards.</p>

<p>At the moment when we were leaving the Triangular
Wood and had about reached the outskirts of the city,
the motorcyclist was in a strange manner literally
yanked from the machine by the force of an explosion
and cut in two. He disappeared in a great cloud of
smoke and dust. The wind was blowing rather hard
and it cleared away quickly. We saw a Territorial on
duty and he signaled with his rifle to stop at the side of
the man who had been killed. The time and place had
been well chosen, but there was nothing to do but obey,
so my driver set the brakes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>poilu</i> said very calmly:</p>

<p>"I stopped you to tell you that you've got to go
very fast along here. You see that man cut in two.
It's a wicked spot. I've been here for two hours with
instructions to tell that to everyone who passes here.
That's the order!"</p>


<div class="right">
THE FOURTH ZOUAVES' BATHTUB, NIEUPORT.<br />
<i>July</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>For several months I lived among the ruins of
Madame S&mdash;&mdash;'s villa, having my quarters on the first
floor. My orderly replaced the shattered window
panes with bits of linoleum. Opening on the sea, the
rooms were only partially destroyed. When Commandant
Peigné left for Oostdunkerke, he turned this
sumptuous apartment over to me.</p>

<p>From every angle, in my opinion, it was certainly
the most comfortable spot of any in Nieuport-Baths,
and particularly in the villa: the rest of it having
been more or less wrecked by bombardment.</p>

<p>On the ground floor there was a grand piano which
could still be played.</p>

<p>The furniture in my bedroom was still in place,
also there was a magnificent bathtub, of the portable
kind, which certainly had not been used for a long
time.</p>

<p>One fine day I discovered with chagrin that the
bathtub had disappeared from the apartment! Immediately
I inquired every place, besides protesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
vehemently against this inexplicable theft. As we had
our mess in the house, I could not help but believe that
someone had entered my rooms without the knowledge
of our cooks and secretaries and taken my one luxury.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Finally I had an explanation of this mystery. One
day, very early in the morning, I was in a first-line
trench, held by the 4th Zouaves, and was preparing
to go into the cantonment for breakfast, when one of
my comrades stopped me and insisted that I wait for
<i>jus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> which would soon come up, and have some with
him.</p>

<p>It arrived shortly, boiling, carried by two men, in
milady's exquisite bathtub; and she would have blushed
to the roots of her hair could she have seen those
scoundrels&mdash;&mdash;</p>


<div class="right">
THE BRICK BRIDGE, BEFORE ST. GEORGES.<br />
<i>July</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>Why is this wooden bridge called the "Brick
Bridge"?</p>

<p>The latter is not exactly the right name. Perhaps
it is because the little wooden bridge thrown over the
evacuation canal at some time has been taken for one
of brick by an officer of the Intelligence Corps while
studying the map, and he has so baptized it.</p>

<p>One afternoon, I was sitting in a communicating
trench at the side of Reymond, a few paces from the
Brick Bridge.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<p>It was a bright, sunny day and the boches were
bombarding us with 105's. The shells passed ten or
twelve feet over our heads, whistling loudly and exploded
in the brickyard 200 yards on the other side
of the Passchendael canal&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"If they lower their fire we are gone," said Reymond.</p>

<p>The sport lasted an hour and they did not change
the elevation of their artillery, fortunately. I was
prepared that day to await calmly anything that
came. One gets accustomed, progressively, to chatting
unconcernedly and without a trembling of the
voice when waiting for a mocking death that does not
come&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"But I have it," said Reymond. "I know why it is
called the Brick Bridge&mdash;because the brickyard is
opposite&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>So we were satisfied that day.</p>


<div class="right">
THE QUEEN'S FLAG.<br />
<i>July</i> 21, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>To-day it is the anniversary-fête of the independence
of Belgium, and as we are at the extreme point of
the Allied line of defense, on Belgian territory, a captain
of the 8th Tirailleurs and myself had the idea of
raising a little Belgian flag on the listening post at the
Great Dune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The enemy's listening post faced us and was only
fifteen yards from our own. It was there we exchanged,
in ordinary times, bread, packages of tobacco,
newspapers, hand grenades and rifle shots&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>We went to search for a flag that was red, yellow
and black, at the dugout of the chaplain of the 16th
Territorials, who had ornamented the altar of his
chapel with French colors and those of the Allies.</p>

<p>The breeze was fresh enough and our little flag
waved haughtily in the face of our adversary.</p>

<p>All day the Germans, as if enraged, fired volleys at
our flag. The cloth was riddled with bullets, the staff
itself split in two pieces. When it fell one of our
Tirailleurs went crouching out and replaced it.</p>

<p>That night I took it down myself, rolled it up and
carried it back.</p>

<p>The following day I sent the flag to Dr. Depage
at La Panne. A few hours later it graced the boudoir
of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"Ah," said our Tirailleurs, "it brings him good luck,
this souvenir of July 21&mdash;she has kept it!"</p>

Lombaertzyde.</p>

<p>I am comfortably seated in a wicker armchair by
the side of Commandant Martel and we have seen the
penumbra deepen as darkness falls. Jupiter sparkles
in the heavens; in the distance vagrant flashes of fire
appear like a lingering hunting party.</p>

<p>We are waiting for a squad of Territorials to bring
up several portable storage batteries (Vedovelli's system)
to light the commandant's post. They were contained
in cumbersome boxes and the good man had provided
adjustable handles in order to make the work
easier for the men. These he had shown to us.</p>

<p>But I was not a bit surprised when my Territorials
did not arrive at the appointed time, because, in spite
of Vedovelli's "handles," the boxes were so heavy as
to be scarcely movable.</p>

<p>Finally I saw two of them coming, dripping with
sweat, puffing, their eyes bulging, equipped naturally
with their packs and with warm winter clothing for
the approaching winter campaign.</p>

<p>At last they arrived. Letting the box with the
adjustable handles fall brutally, they cried in unison
as if compensated for the load:</p>

<p>"<i>Nom de Dieu de tous les noms de Dieu</i>, I hope
this damned box with its dirty handles bursts in the
inventor's stomach!"</p>

A SHELL IN MY HOME, NIEUPORT.<br />

<p>I am just about to start writing in my room, when
suddenly, a boche shell explodes some place in the

<p>A loud detonation&mdash;smoke&mdash;shell fragments and

<p>Our corporal-secretary lies in a pool of blood,
gravely wounded in the thigh.</p>

<p>The "little fellow," shod in his sandals which he
never has off, is already at his side. He believed it
was I that was struck. With him I carry the wounded

<p>A Marine Fusilier conceived the drôle idea of unscrewing
from one of the abandoned coaches in Nieuport
one of these little notices that the railroad company
places under each window to warn travelers of
the dangers of poking their heads out. The little
enameled sign had been nailed by him on a plank in
one of the first-line traverses, where one could read,
with profit, this notice:</p>

<p>"It is dangerous to stick your head out here!"</p>

RICHARD'S GOD-MOTHER, ON THE YSER.<br />
<i>August</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>"Listen, Richard, a pretty marquise has requested
that I find her a god-son! Do you want to be elected?</p>

<p>"You are a husky lad like all the Marine Fusiliers,
your behavior was good at Steenstraat, you are also
good-looking, in short you have all the required attributes
that go to make up a perfect god-son."</p>

<p>"With pleasure, lieutenant, thanks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In that case I will take your photograph immediately,
in the midst of your comrades, so that I
can send one to your god-mother. She will be carried
away! I forgot to tell you that the Marquise de
R&mdash;&mdash; is charming and you will be spoiled as no one
else&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Some days after I sent Richard the picture which
he slipped in a letter addressed to his god-mother&mdash;a
very nice letter and well written.</p>

<p>A few days later the young chap told me that he
was going on his vacation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't fail, Richard, to call on your god-mother,"
I cautioned, adding with a smile, "and don't forget to
kiss her for me."</p>

<p>It was only a short while before I received the following
letter from the Marquise de R&mdash;&mdash;:</p>

<p>"You have sent me a charming god-son, but the day
of his arrival he seized me in his arms as if with all
his strength and planted a sonorous kiss on both
cheeks, saying, 'On behalf of my god-father!'</p>

<p>"It appears that you are his god-father! I am still
thrilled by it. I pardon you this time because this
brave boy has lifted a small corner of the great veil
that hangs over Paris and which hides your sufferings.
You are bold, he told me&mdash;do not expose yourself uselessly.</p>

<p>"The life in Paris is once more the same as ever.
I am sending you some Parma violets, since you like
them. They are all that I could find. I seldom go
out. It is quite a long time since you have written&mdash;&mdash;"</p>


<div class="right">
CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE ENEMY, BEFORE ST. GEORGES.<br />
<i>August</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>On arriving at the "Brick Bridge" to-night, I found
everyone in great spirits. There was a group along
the edge of the canal&mdash;in the middle was a boche
prisoner.</p>

<p>The big lumbering cuss had the air of complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
bewilderment. Our marines were all talking to him
at once and harassing him with a thousand questions.
An officer approached.</p>

<p>"Quiet, men! Two men to conduct this fellow to
the Brigade Headquarters, and lively!" They took
the road, followed by the German, who kept at their
heels like a pet dog.</p>

<p>The officer explained that for several days his
marines had maintained correspondence with him.
They placed their messages in a bottle which drifted
along with the current. The boche had written:</p>

<p>"My wife has advised me to surrender, but you are
terrible soldiers&mdash;you certainly would massacre me."</p>

<p>Some hours later the reply of the marines came to
reassure him that everything would be all right.</p>

<p>This tableau lasted several days and "Jean Gouin"
ended by believing that it was a ruse of the enemy
and ceased to write. Finally a message came to them,
drifting along in the bottle:</p>

<p>"To-night I will come along the slope of the canal.
Do not shoot at me. I am the father of four children."</p>

<p>And so, when night fell, they saw a big, black mass
creeping along the edge of the bluff. Our fusiliers
were ready to spring, but he was alone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With his two guardians the deserter was taken a
roundabout way. They passed along the whole first
line of the north sector because the two Marines wanted
to parade the boche before their comrades.</p>

<p>They were proud of this capture and gave their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
prisoner cigarettes, and bread, and one of them had
the generosity to slip a box of <i>singe</i><a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> into his pocket!</p>

<p>They led him farther, almost to the road to Lombaertzyde,
to show him to the Zouaves, and finally
took the road for Brigade Headquarters.</p>

<p>In the sector held by the 2nd Regiment of Marine
Fusiliers they discussed this incident for a long
time.</p>

<p>Commandant de Jonquières invited my comrade,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>A room is still habitable and there is found, admirably

<p>What a menu! The Marines dine well. The second

in the vestibule: a 105 has burst in the house and the
dining-room is filled with dust and smoke.</p>

<p>Commandant de Jonquières without rising from his
chair cries out:</p>

<p>"Anybody hit, men?"</p>

<p>A Marine investigates and replies:</p>

<p>"Nobody, commandant, but there is some plaster in
the cream. Shall I replenish it?"</p>

<p>"Listen. You have forgotten to write '<i>Petite

That's all!" And, turning to us, he said, as if nothing

of?"</p>

<p>"The death of Commandant Jeanniot, at Dixmude&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was deep silence, for they all recalled it. A
man, aside from the others, had listened closely without
speaking&mdash;the others turned toward him:</p>

<p>"And you, <i>le vieux</i>, what would you say?"</p>

<p>"The saddest? <i>Allons</i>, you have forgotten then

THE RED LANTERN AT THE FIRST AID STATION, NIEUPORT.<br />

<p>There were casualties to-day. I am waiting for
Thiébaut, my sergeant, and a squad of men, with whom
I am going into the cantonment to-night at Nieuport.</p>

<p>We are to meet at the First Aid Station and a few
men are stretched out on litters moaning. There is
one particularly, who is suffering terribly: he has been
shot through the stomach and the surgeon says in a
hushed voice he will die on the way to the rear. Poor
chap, his breathing is labored. They are waiting for
an English ambulance to carry them, which will arrive
soon, I hope&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The odor of ether and dressings, mingled with the
smell of blood, sickens me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I go outside from time to time, to see if my men
have not come up. A company of Fusiliers are being
relieved and they file past me. One hears the hurried
shuffling of feet. Then an artillery duel starts up.
It is very dark in the street. The lantern hanging
there casts sinister shadows on the men. Intermittently
the sky is brightened up by enemy star-shell.
Their lines are less than a mile away.</p>

<p>A soldier passing says to his friend:</p>

THE LOCK-KEEPER'S HOUSE, NIEUPORT.<br />
<i>August</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>Two of my men, Poulet and Chandonnay, were living
in the cellar of the lock-keeper's home where they
were guarding some material I had sent up. Also,
there was a picket of Territorials.</p>

<p>I left Poulet and Chandonnay this particular morning
at the moment they themselves went to have dinner
with their comrades a short distance away. I had
given them leave until after breakfast because I
wanted to make some changes in the arrangement of
my precious storehouse.</p>

<p>It was one of those little Flemish brick homes where
the roof and two stories had been shattered by bombardment,
nevertheless in much better condition than
the neighboring ones.</p>

<p>I, also, went to dinner on the other side of the locks,
where the Marines held the sector.</p>

<p>The bombardment had slackened somewhat, but
from time to time 420's came over, and, exploding,
shook everything.</p>

<p>At the time I had fixed for the return of my <i>poilus</i>
to the cellar of the lock-keeper's home, I was not a
little surprised to see them coming to meet me.</p>

<p>"How is it," I said, "that you are not at your post
where you should be, or in the dugout in safety?"</p>

<p>"Our post," they replied, stupefied, "our post&mdash;what
post, lieutenant?"</p>

<p>"The lock-keeper's house."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's gone!"</p>

<p>I was a bit angry, but we at last arrived at the
spot where it should have been. They were perfectly
right. There was no more lock-keeper's house! A
420, during our absence, had literally fallen right on
the roof of the cellar.</p>

<p>"And the Territorials?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Chopped meat, lieutenant, chopped meat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

embankment of sandbags, which protects the pier
from shells that are coming over fast.</p>

<p>It is almost midnight and the brave Territorial looks
continually at the sea which splashes at his feet.</p>

<p>Suddenly the man hears an unusual sound in the
water in front of him. He is all attention and cries
out:</p>

<p>"Halt, there! Who goes?"</p>

<p>The night is clear and soon he sees two dripping
arms stuck high in the air.</p>

<p>"What are you doing there&mdash;this is not the time to
go in swimming&mdash;advance with the countersign&mdash;it's
a boche!"</p>

<p>"Kamarad! Kamarad!..."</p>

<div class="right">
THE FANCIFUL IDEA OF MAJOR PETIT, VERDUN.<br />
<i>October</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>In the middle of the month of October, 1915, I
was invited to dinner by General Coutanceau,
Governor of Verdun.</p>

<p>Verdun, at this particular time, still retained its
aspect of a little garrison city in times of peace, and,
when I entered Bevaux Barrack, I felt far away from
the war&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I found Colonel Masselin who awaited me in his office,
busy as was his habit and who rose precipitately on
seeing me enter the room.</p>

<p>"There you are&mdash;it is fine! The general is home
and it is the hour to sit at table&mdash;he does not like to
be late."</p>

<p>Some moments after, I was in the presence of the
Governor of Verdun, a man very big, very cold, with a
severe and glacial face.</p>

<p>We immediately entered the dining-room with its
barren walls like those of a school-room, but brightened
by a great wood fire, which burned joyously on the
hearth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>We sat down and the general placed me at his side;
the menu was excellent and the wines perfect. My
neighbor, in spite of his severe mask, was a very fine
and spirited conversationist, also this dinner, I felt,
was for me a real luxury, inasmuch as I had the
pleasure of finding myself in the company of this man
of <i>esprit</i>.</p>

<p>One spoke naturally of the war and I stated that
in my opinion this epoch did not resemble the others
from the point of view of the relations that could exist
between two adversaries in the course of hostilities. In
effect, it was our custom in youth to recite of truce-parties
who came with bandaged eyes into enemy lines
to make one or another communication to the commander
of the adverse troops.</p>

<p>I added that the perfection of the art of destruction
had killed the romantic side of war and that it was
very regrettable.</p>

<p>The general protested, remarking that adventurous
examples were not lacking, and as far as he was concerned,
he was able to relate a story within his knowledge
that was worth the trouble of telling.</p>

<p>This is what he told us and to which we all listened
with very great silence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some months before war was declared, one of my
old friends on his death bed urgently recommended his
son to me.</p>

<p>The young Count de Marnac was a worthy youngster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and to his misfortune&mdash;and to mine&mdash;he was a
<i>Camelot du Roi</i>.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, a boy very daring and full of the best
sentiments. I was convinced he would be an excellent
soldier. Sergeant in a regiment of infantry, he fought
like a lion in the Belgian campaign and immediately
distinguished himself. His colonel proposed him for a
sub-lieutenant and I transmitted the request to General
Sarrail, under whose orders I then was.</p>

<p>Was it for political opinions or for some other reason,
I know nothing of it, but the propositions I received
from his colonel and which I hastened to send
to the General, were held without reply&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>So, during the battle of the Marne, the Division to
which my <i>protégé</i> belonged was on the right bank of
the Meuse; I came, as you know, to be completely
surrounded by the Germans for a period of forty-eight
hours.</p>

<p>From that moment, I depended no longer on General
Sarrail, from whom I was totally cut off.</p>

<p>So, an old order authorized generals commanding a
besieged or surrounded spot to nominate officers up
to a certain rank.</p>

<p>Having still in mind the last recommendation of
young de Marnac, I hastened to send him his brevet
of sub-lieutenant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Up to here there is nothing romantic in my story,
but you will see how this animal recompensed me for
my kindness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
<p>During the month of November, 1914, his Division
was engaged in murderous fighting.</p>

<p>He had a battalion chief, named Petit, known in his
regiment for his lack of mental equilibrium. He always
had ideas more or less strange and fanciful, and
he always caused comment by his eccentricities and
his <i>bizarreries</i>.</p>

<p>I had ordered an operation to commence in the
morning of the 15th, and Petit told all his men, before
the attack, that he would give one dollar for every pair
of German trousers they brought to him!</p>

<p>Do not laugh, he had more extravagant ideas than
that!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The attack was successful and our <i>poilus</i> struck a
hard blow; they took numerous prisoners and reaped
a mountain of trousers!</p>

<p>This sight was absolutely grotesque; the boches did
not know what we wanted with them and this "kilty"
disguise did not go well with them at all.</p>

<p>Petit, himself, was literally jubilant, splitting his
sides with laughter before the German column about to
start for the rear trouser-less.</p>

<p>Lieutenant de Marnac was furious, because he could
not admit he carried on war in this manner and took
it upon himself to go into the German lines, on a
truce, and present his excuses to the general commanding
the Division in front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>He fixed a white handkerchief on the end of his
cane, took a bugler with him and calmly started out
toward the enemy trenches.</p>

<p>All went well enough; the Germans bandaged his
eyes and as he conveniently spoke the language, he
asked the first officer he met to be conducted into the
presence of the general of that Division.</p>

<p>The latter lived in a little village ten miles back
of the lines so de Marnac's journey was long enough.</p>

<p>He did not arrive, until darkness had fallen, at the
farm which served as headquarters of the boche general.</p>

<p>The general was at dinner when they presented our
young man to him. He received him courteously and
spoke French to him, but with difficulty.</p>

<p>"Sit down&mdash;what have you to say to me?"</p>

<p>And turning toward the young girl who served him,
he added, "Mademoiselle, will you place another cover
for the lieutenant? Monsieur, I listen."</p>

<p>"General, I am the interpreter for General Coutanceau,
Governor of Verdun, and have come to present
his excuses for an event that occurred to-day.</p>

<p>"This morning, in course of the attack at Consenvoie
Wood, a French battalion major ordered his soldiers
to cut the suspenders of all German prisoners they
might take and to bring him the trousers, in return for
which they would receive a dollar.</p>

<p>"Matters happened this way: our soldiers cut numerous
suspenders, removing quite a few trousers from
your infantrymen&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Governor General charges me to tell you he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
deplores this act as being unchivalrous and to present
to you his excuses and his regards."</p>

<p>The boche general turned crimson because he had
misunderstood de Marnac and when the latter had
spoken of "cut suspenders" he certainly imagined some
enormous thing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He showed by his nervousness the lack of linguistic
knowledge he possessed. He called an interpreter and
it was explained to him.</p>

<p>He found then that the reason for the truce was
very decent and his face flushed with pleasure.</p>

<p>During all this scene the little girl, who incessantly
busied herself about the table and who had not lost
a word, bit her lips to keep from giggling.</p>

<p>Dinner over, de Marnac requested of the German
general that he be allowed to retire.</p>

<p>He got up and the general charged him with a thousand
pleasant sentiments for me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>At the moment when he stepped out the door the
little girl was lying in wait for him and whispered in
his ear:</p>

<p>"We count on you for Victory!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On leaving the German general's headquarters, his
eyes were bandaged and he and his bugler were led
back into our lines.</p>

<p>Having reached his post, he made out a complete
report of what had taken place and forwarded it to
me by the usual channels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Judge my astonishment on reading the pamphlet,
I cried:</p>

<p>"They are absolutely crazy, both of them? Ought
to be put in a strait jacket."</p>

<p>Then, I thought immediately of the scandal this
story would stir up and the consequences which would
follow. I was absolutely astounded.</p>

<p>After having reflected for some time, I sent this
report to General Sarrail&mdash;without comment, naturally,
and then I awaited the tempest.</p>

<p>The storm broke!&mdash;Sarrail got me on the telephone
and called me a lot of pretty names. He was furious,
and I swear he had reason&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your <i>protégé</i> is doing nicely, I compliment
you!&mdash;--"</p>

<p>"Yes, general, he is completely crazy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will have that fellow executed immediately&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You forget the story of the trousers, general&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was a fine idea of yours to appoint him sub-lieutenant,
I compliment you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is also the story of the trousers, general&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>General Sarrail sent Sub-Lieutenant de Marnac's report
to great headquarters. Major Petit and de Marnac
were arrested immediately and things were going
entirely wrong&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I was able, nevertheless, to save the young fool, by
repeating this:</p>

<p>"Yes, but there is the story of the trousers!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, Petit and de Marnac were given thirty days
confinement, and I commenced to breathe.</p>

<p>You believe my story to be ended? Not at all! The
most important episode was not long in coming, to
my very great confusion.</p>

<p>January 1, 1915, at the break of day and in the
same sector that the foregoing events transpired, a
German lieutenant advanced toward our lines with a
white flag and a bugler.</p>

<p>The officer carried an immense package under his
arm, which was wrapped in pasteboard.</p>

<p>They bandaged the eyes of both and led them into
our lines.</p>

<p>Conducted to the colonel, the boche lieutenant announced
he had a communication to make to me. They
reached me on the telephone and I gave the order to
send him on.</p>

<p>I waited impatiently for an hour, I swear, and I
was far from imagining what was coming&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The young man was brought into my office; he was
a large and solid chap, who planted himself in front of
me and saluted with respect.</p>

<p>"I listen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a strong Teutonic accent he said to me in
French:</p>

<p>"His Imperial Highness, the German Crown Prince,
commander of the opposing army, has charged me to
bring you this package!&mdash;--"</p>

<p>I slowly untied the string that bound the package,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
in which I found a framed photograph of the German
Crown Prince and in the corner he had likewise written
in French:</p>

<p>"To my loyal and chivalrous adversary! William,
Crown Prince of Germany."</p>

<p>I was absolutely nonplused and I dismissed the boche
lieutenant, whom I was on the verge of cursing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"And the portrait?" I asked General Coutanceau&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I forwarded it by the usual military channels.
General Sarrail did not fail to notice the outcome,
but I never knew what became of the picture&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Turning toward me with his rare smile:</p>

<p>"You will agree that this story is a <i>veritable</i>
romance!"</p>

RECOMPENSE, BEFORE ORNES.<br />
<i>October</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>All night we have worked in No Man's Land.</p>

<p>What a night!</p>

<p>We had to install certain wire entanglements and
<i>chevaux de frise</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> in front of our trench of the first
line.</p>

<p>Happily the boche mitrailleuse in front of Moulin
d'Ornes did not fire; otherwise we would have been
riddled!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>
<p>My men went at it vigorously and all the work had
been terminated&mdash;I had divided them into several
gangs and had recommended the new wire network be
placed parallel to the old.</p>

<p>I went over the entire line to survey the work and to
observe the patrols who protected the men ahead of
the trenches.</p>

<p>One of my gangs just missed causing us a villainous
adventure! They stumbled on some wire, which
by shell-fire had been thrown out of line, and following
it, they had worked directly toward the enemy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>They had placed their <i>chevaux de frise</i> one after the
other and I stopped stupefied on making this
discovery. I had for a moment the impression that
my men had been picked up by the boches. Fortunately
not a shot had been heard and I said to myself
it would probably be possible to repair the error committed.</p>

<p>First it was necessary to find my <i>poilus</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I followed the line of <i>chevaux de frise</i>, my revolver
in hand. Thus I arrived a few yards from the boche
wire entanglements. My men were not there and it
was likely they had gone taking the material to the
village. An hour later I found them and started them
again on the work.</p>

<p>All the rest of the night passed without incident&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>At daybreak I brought my workers and patrols
back to Ornes, all satisfied with the work accomplished.
On reaching the cantonment I said to them:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Mes enfants</i>, you have done well to-night and I am
very much pleased with you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>One of the <i>poilus</i> I had known for a long time, replied:</p>

<p>"Can I ask you a favor, lieutenant?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Since you are pleased with us, we all would like to
have god-mothers!"</p>

<p>"It is understood&mdash;you will have them!"</p>

<p>That is how the squad from Ornes got a very serious
contingent of god-mothers to the great happiness
of my <i>poilus</i>, who received that winter woolen socks
and warm slippers!</p>

THE DAY OF MY ARRIVAL, EPARGES.<br />
<i>October</i> 7, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>When I come here for the first time I cannot
help but feel that I will pass the unhappiest
moments of my life&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Upon arriving at Calonne trench and descending
toward Mesnil-sur-les-Côtes, I perceive Eparges on the
right. With its mine craters, its smoke, this barren
hill, tinted red, appears like a kind of Stromboli&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The road all the way to Longeau is simply exquisite.
Eparges mill, demolished almost completely,
and overgrown with grass already recalls the ruins of
some ancient abbey.</p>

<p>I have traversed the length of the sector with a
friend&mdash;it is very active to-day. The boches, at break
of day, exploded four mines simultaneously. A section
of the trench is completely demolished and a hundred
men have been killed&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>We are on the verge of contact with the enemy and
it is necessary to crouch over dead bodies and sandbags
to observe what is transpiring in front of us&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>


<div class="right">
GUNTHER DUGOUT, THE CORRUGATED IRON, THE RATS,<br />
THE MAP, THE LETTERS, EPARGES.<br />
<i>November</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>At the beginning our shelter was nothing more or
less than a mole hole.</p>

<p>Little by little it is becoming habitable. The walls
have been boarded and the ceiling made of corrugated
iron.</p>

<p>A long, large, white table, with benches&mdash;&mdash;. How
many of us will no longer sit there! Everyone found
in this little space is loved like a brother.</p>

<p>On the board wall which separates the room from
our sleeping quarters, which is arranged like a sleeping-car,
there is a map of Alsace-Lorraine. Gunther,
with his big fist, has traced an arrow in ink, which
points from Eparges to Strasbourg. He has written:</p>

<p>"The hearts and aspirations of the 14th Company
of the 15th Corps point this way!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At night the rats, with an unseasonable boldness,
run up and down between the corrugated iron and the
roof. One doesn't know if they're playing or fighting.
These gallops on the metal awake us with a start.</p>

<p>A flash from my electric lamp and I discover an
immense rat tearing across the room with a telephone
message sent to me at the moment I retired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Ménard and Foulu prepare the evening meal before
the arrival of the post-sergeant. The little fireplace
at the side blazes cheerfully and fills the dugout with
the pleasant odor of burning wood.</p>

<p>Happiness is his who can relax completely after a
rough day&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The post-sergeant arrives drenched, his package of
letters and newspapers carefully wrapped. He seems
ill at ease as if he finds himself in a palace.</p>

<p>"Ménard, give your friend a quart of <i>pinard</i>."</p>

<p>The paquet of letters for Captain Gunther is always
very large. Many of them commence like this:</p>

<p>"I thank you from the bottom of my heart for
having given us details of the death of our boy. We
are proud of him."</p>

<p>Then there are others cheerful enough, others very
sad.</p>

<p>I found a short while ago some of the last wild
flowers, while returning from the front line. I have
slipped them into my letters that are about to go.
Oh! you who will receive these flowers will never know
what one can suffer here!</p>

<p>"The filth?"</p>

<p>"Yes, captain, here I am."</p>

<p>It is at Eparges, during the month of November,
1915. We are in Captain Gunther's dugout, who
commands the 14th Company, 15th Corps of Engineers.</p>

<p>The weather is horrible. Outside the rain falls incessantly.
The mud, the mud, the rotten, cursed mud is
everywhere.</p>

<p>Our shelter is damp. Water filters through the
board walls and falls in large drops. A dim candle
light. The sector is very quiet.</p>

<p>St. André stands in the threshold. He is covered
with mud from head to foot. What a trip it is to get
here! His stalwart face is dripping with rain; this
brave young lad of nineteen radiates health and good
nature.</p>

<p>"Did you spend a nice vacation?"</p>

<p>"Not very good, captain."</p>

<p>"Not very good? Where did you go?"</p>

<p>"To Rennes."</p>

<p>"Did they not welcome you as they should?"</p>

<p>"No, captain, they treated me like a slacker. They
said, 'What! not wounded or killed&mdash;you're not a real
<i>poilu</i>!'"</p>

<p>"But, <i>mon petit</i>, you should have said you came from
Eparges, the wickedest sector along the front."</p>

<p>"No chance to talk with those people. Our conversation
ended in blows."</p>

<p>"At least, you have done your bit for France by giving
her 'little St. André's,' <i>poilus</i> and sturdy like yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes, captain, I'm not married&mdash;but I've got two
sons."</p>

<p>"You are not married? You are going to marry
her right away, my boy. You could easily have an
accident here, and you would not embarrass your little
friend&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's true, captain&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am going to give you two days' vacation so you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>

from the mayor."</p>

<p>"Captain&mdash;I want to tell you&mdash;I would rather marry
by proxy."</p>

<p>"By proxy! That's a strange idea&mdash;and why?"</p>

THE PASSWORD, DIEUE-SUR-MEUSE.<br />
<i>November</i>, 1915.<br />

<p>It is night&mdash;I return in a covered automobile with
Colonel d'Auriac. At the road which crosses that to
St. Mihiel, a sentinel waves his lantern&mdash;the machine
stops.</p>

<p>"The password?"</p>

<p>"Marne!"</p>

<p>"That's not it!"</p>

<p>"What! That's not it? Call the head of the post,"
said the colonel nervously.</p>

<p>In a few moments that seemed long enough to us,
the <i>poilu</i> brought the head of the post, who dragged
his feet as if half asleep.</p>

<p>"The password?"</p>

<p>"Marne!"</p>

<p>"Pass!"</p>

<p>"Wait! How is this, sergeant, when I give the
word to the sentry, he does not let me pass through;

<div class="right">
AT THE ANNIVERSARY OF AUSTERLITZ, EPARGES.<br />
<i>December</i> 1, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>It is the eve of Austerlitz. To-night and to-morrow
we are going to celebrate the memory of our forefathers,
the Emperor's Old Guard, who will shake in
their graves with joy.</p>

<p>It is snowing. The night is bright with moon. Rifle
shots resound loudly in the darkness. From time to
time, are exchanged by one and then the other, rounds
of machine-gun fire at fleeing shadows during the slow
descent of star-shell.</p>

<p>I arrive from Verdun and my automobile is filled
with everything I could hastily collect in the stores.
We have a basket of oysters, fine white bread and fresh
butter&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The florist in Verdun, a big fellow, always restless
and uneasy, who will foretell the worst misfortunes
until the end of his life, has given me an armful of
roses and mimosas, that will look pretty there.</p>

<p>There will be cigars for our friends and for our
<i>poilus</i>, and champagne, naturally&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>We have been arranging for this little fête for a
long time; there will be quite a lot of us: thirteen or
fourteen infantrymen, sappers, artillerists, all old
habitués of the sector.</p>

<p>We are taking with us all those who have been sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
back for rest. When we pass Mont-sur-les-Côtes, the
sentinel stops and becomes pensive at seeing seven or
eight officers piled together in the little machine. It
is terribly crowded. What loud bursts of laughter!
How wonderful life is among young men of the same
age who have made the supreme sacrifice of their existence
and know the least of that fugitive joy that falls
to a soldier's lot.</p>

<p>Each one brings something to the dinner, some have
<i>pâté de foie gras</i>, others <i>petits pois</i>, and pastry.</p>

<p>How late it was when our automobile brought us
a half-mile from the first line&mdash;this is what caused a
reprimand from the "general staff" some days later!</p>

<p>The boches are very quiet: not a rifle shot, not a
cannon shot. The St. Remy searchlight which generally
plays on the Eparges road is out to-night.</p>

<p>We have climbed Eparges hill&mdash;we pass through the
ruins of the village and they are silhouetted like
Christmas eve decorations. The enemy is very near
to us and it is drôle to think we have scaled the height
to pass an evening, a real live pleasure party.</p>

<p>When we arrive finally at Captain Gunther's dugout,
there are cries of joy&mdash;. All his staff assist us with
the numerous packages. The brave Ménard, with his
commanding presence, his flowing mustache and kindly
eyes, spares no pains to see that we are settled.</p>

<p>Our dugout has become quite comfortable since the
installation of electric lights. Everything is perfect;
there is not a hitch.</p>

<p>It is so crowded, elbow to elbow, that we throw off
our tunics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>What a dinner! The oysters and champagne are
the best. Oyster forks in this region made us all
think&mdash;Ménard had a Prince Albert coat on over his
uniform. Where did he get it? Mystery!</p>

<p>There is singing, laughing. They become grave
when speaking of the comrades who are no more&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>From time to time the ruffled form of one of our
<i>poilus</i> passes out the door. They know we have not
forgotten them. They carry a bottle, a pâté, or a
box of cigars&mdash;and so the fête extends even to the
advanced posts of the first line.</p>

<p>From the listening post to-morrow they will throw
oyster shells at German heads. What faces they will
make. Surely they will place them in their geological
museum at Berlin.</p>

<p>The flowers on the table, a fantasy of color, cause
some to weep with emotion. We have the most profound
respect for them: "How come you here in the
center of death and destruction&mdash;you come to us from
the warm, beautiful countryside&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I glance at my friends, Berthet, Blanc, Grabinski,
the brave Grab, Flament, the doctor, and the staunch
face of my captain&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>We speak of the great Emperor and compare our
army with his&mdash;How proud he would be of our <i>poilus</i>!
What would he have done if he had had airplanes?</p>

<p>The time for champagne has come; Gunther drinks
to all: the infantry, artillery, engineers, and the absent
comrades. His voice trembles with emotion&mdash;"High
Hearts! The road will be yet long. France has her
eyes on us! Our lives belong to her. We will be happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to give them. If we are killed our children will be
proud of us!"</p>

<p>In my turn, I speak to them of the Eparges&mdash;At
this anniversary I feel the blood of my ancestors
tingling in my veins, because I am a great grandson of a
veteran of the First Empire.</p>

<p>I drink to Eparges, for each one of its letters is the
beginning of a word representing the military virtues
we must practice here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Encouragement.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Perseverance.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Ardor.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Resolution.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Greatness.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Energy.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Sublimity.</span><br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Champagne and liquor have their effect&mdash;now the
music commences!</p>

<p>First the "Marseillaise" rings out. Could the boches
have heard us from the bottom of their pits they would
realize we were all ready to conquer or to die.</p>

<p>Then each one sings his little <i>chanson</i>&mdash;these pretty
French songs full of verve and spirit. How odd it is
to hear sung "The Marriage of Mademoiselle Fallières,"
here in this dugout, mute witness to so much drama&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The hour to separate has come. Each must take
up his duties, save those who return to the rear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>It is midnight&mdash;and it is clear and calm.</p>

<p>I leave with Captain Gunther to go into the first
line. It is well that our <i>poilus</i> see that we are at their
side&mdash;are they not our brothers? We wish as well to
know what the boches are doing!</p>

<p>We enter a mine gallery where the work goes on
actively. Our sappers are digging fast for the enemy
is working feverishly also. It is he who explodes it
first&mdash;as usual!</p>

<p>"They are ahead of us&mdash;they're digging their hole,"
said one of Grenet's men.</p>

<p>He spoke with calm and indifference.</p>

<p>On the menaced part of the front the number of
men has been lessened, save only in the little posts, where
they wait events stoically.</p>

<p>Coming outside, a <i>poilu</i>, with an undefinable accent,
says:</p>

<p>"Then they're going to spring it to-night?"</p>

<p>"Who told you that story?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's no need in hiding it&mdash;I'm not blind
and I know what it means to go back there&mdash;On a
night like this it wouldn't bother me a bit to be shot
like an arrow up to the stars!"</p>

<p>Our rounds are finished. We can go back to our
dugout and profit by the hours of quiet to get much
needed rest.</p>

<p>In going into Sap 13 again, I look up at the heavens.
My brain is so tired that I seem to see a cortège of
soldiers. Are they the Old Guard and our <i>poilus</i>, our
brave <i>poilus</i>? Yes, decidedly, the Old Guard is feasting
up there, the Old Guard of Austerlitz&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The earth, in this clear and luminous night, appears
in bold relief and one sees between the torn tree trunks,
arms reaching out of the ground, arms lifted to the
German heaven, and our own dead fallen on this cursed
soil of the Eparges&mdash;they seem to contemplate the
great fête up there&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is the morrow.</p>

<p>What horrible weather! It is raining in torrents.
Everything is soaked. Again we shall have to flounder
about in mud up to the middle.</p>

<p>However, it is impossible to complain of your fix
when you have flowers in your dugout!</p>

<p>During the morning a heavy detonation shakes the
entire hill. It is these German pigs, decidedly, who
have exploded the first one. They choose their time
well.</p>

<p>Everyone dashes down to lend a hand to our comrades
who are on duty. We shall have to reëstablish
the trench and evacuate the wounded.</p>

<p>If you attempt to go fast you get nowhere. The
mud glues itself to your feet. The ground smells bad.</p>

<p>But it was not serious, only a warning, and soon I
am back in the dugout, dripping from the neck down.
It is the time to write.</p>

<p>I am alone with Cadet Flament, who, stripped of
his tunic and wearing his blue jersey, has rather the
air of a collegian. He is, however, a brave young fellow,
our little Flament&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Say, Flament, you had better write a letter home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
It is three weeks now since you have given them any
news."</p>

<p>"You're right, lieutenant."</p>

<p>And little Flament began at once to write a long
letter to his mother. She must be proud of her son.
He is the only child. She lives at Château-Thierry.
But what uneasiness, knowing he is at Eparges&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>After having written the first letter, Flament writes
the second. This one also is to a woman! The smile
on his lips when he writes leads me to believe that this
young rascal has a little friend or a fiancée&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I am certain of it when I see him place in a little
box an aluminum ring which he has made himself, and
some flowers from the Eparges, mingled with those we
had at our banquet last night&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lieutenant, when you go down to-night, it will be
very kind of you, if you will take these letters and this
little package&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gladly, <i>mon petit</i>," and I placed in my pocket, the
letter for his mother, the one for the "other," and the
little box destined for her also.</p>

<p>Flament begins to put on his shoes which he has
vainly tried to dry out&mdash;. It will be necessary to keep
them in the stove for three days to obtain this result.</p>

<p>Without question he has written to the woman he
loves&mdash;he grumbles at the weather, the rain, at the
cursed mud, at the boches&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Ah! what wouldn't he give to pay those boches back
for having began this holocaust&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly an explosion, more violent than the one
before, shook us in our chairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>It is they this time who have sprung the mine. There
will be many casualties!</p>

<p>We jumped up and left the dugout.</p>

<p>It was raining; but at the same moment the cannonade
raged. French and German shells tore through
the air with frightful screams, an acrid smoke hung
between Montgirmont and Eparges, machine-guns
kicked up a deafening tumult&mdash;you damned coffee-mills&mdash;<i>va!</i></p>

<p>Flament preceded me&mdash;he walked with his head high.
How good-looking he is with his Tam O'Shanter
cocked over one ear in the midst of bursting projectiles,
face to the enemy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A 77 hits him squarely, carrying away his thigh and
half of his face&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>My sergeant and two of his sappers collect the
pieces. They carry this poor corpse, still heaving and
stained with mud, into our little wooden chapel a few
steps away&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An hour later, the flurry being over, I go again to
see him with LeBlond. I have taken the flowers of
the night before and placed them respectfully on his
breast&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Poor young chap! He is unrecognizable. Can this
be the happy little fellow of the night before?</p>

<p>On leaving the chapel, I notice that LeBlond is terribly
affected and I say nothing to him. We arrive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
at the dugout where our brave captain, covered with
mud, sobs like a child for his lost friend&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Taking LeBlond by the arm, I say:</p>

<p>"<i>Mon vieux</i>, you are down-hearted&mdash;go with me
along the whole first line&mdash;we have our dead to avenge!
we must not weep for them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the night LeBlond and I return to Verdun.
Before retiring I reach in my pockets to empty them.
Two letters and a little box rest in my fingers. I
think a long time of these souvenirs of death&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>After hesitating some moments, I say to my friend:</p>

<p>"Decidedly, I will send them to-morrow. These poor
people will not learn too soon the unhappiness they
bring!"</p>

THE PHILOSOPHICAL POILU, EPARGES.<br />
<i>December</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>You will not believe me, but this morning at break
of day, we found ourselves in mud up to our middle!</p>

<p>In the trenches and in the <i>boyaux</i>,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> it was always the
same thing&mdash;the sector was completely calm. <i>Parbleu!</i>
the others in front of us must suffer exactly the same
hardships.</p>

<p>I am numbed! For four days I have been struggling
in this damned mud.</p>

<p>Woevre plain is thick with mist this morning and
Champlon, seen from up there, resembles one of these
pasteboard villages over which a miscreant youngster
has poured water.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>
<p>I sense a feeling of real joy, however, on seeing the
first glimmerings of day, because to-night we shall be
relieved&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I descend into "Precaution Trench," sweeping into
a river of mud, and find myself nose to nose, at the
crossing of Sap 8, with one of my <i>poilus</i>.</p>

<p>On seeing me he cannot refrain from laughing.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at?"</p>

<p>"Lieutenant, what a sight you are! You've got mud
in your hair, and mud on your eyeglass&mdash;you ought
to look in a mirror!"</p>

<p>"Listen, <i>mon petit</i>, it is not necessary to speak of
it, because if one looks around himself here, he always
ends up by finding someone very unhappy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very true, lieutenant, because instead of being in
a lot of mud we could easily find ourselves up to our
necks in something a whole lot worse!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night I am in the home of M. and Mme. Louis
at Verdun.</p>

<p>The good woman has a great wood fire going&mdash;May
God bless her!</p>

<p>I am so numb with cold that I cannot undress&mdash;my
shirt is frozen to my back&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>This good and sweet creature assists me and, hearing
my teeth chatter, weeps softly and murmurs:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"What would his poor mother say if she saw him
in this condition&mdash;&mdash;"</p>


<div class="right">
THE RELIGIOUS POILU, EPARGES.<br />
<i>December</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>Accompanied by one of my <i>poilus</i>, I ran across the
chaplain of the &mdash;&mdash; Regiment of Infantry, in front
of the P. C.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> of the colonel.</p>

<p>We are both in a sorry plight.</p>

<p>The preceding days have been such an accumulation
of physical and moral misery, that I could not help
but say to the priest:</p>

<p>"Father, I feel death hovering around me&mdash;hear my
confession!"</p>

<p>"Confess you here? Do not think of it. You make
your own hell on earth in the Eparges. I will pray
for you. And you, <i>poilu</i>," he added, turning toward my
sapper, "to what religion do you belong?"</p>

<p>"I belong to that which looks God straight in the
eyes!"</p>


<div class="right">
THE MEN OF BRONZE, EPARGES.<br />
<i>December</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>We have just put in some frightful days up there.
The mud, the horrible mud, is infinitely more terrible
than any enemy shells.</p>

<p>It is relief day!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<p>What luck to end this nightmare. One is sad, however,
for the others who come to take your place.</p>

<p>The Eparges soil is red&mdash;our uniforms of horizon
blue, dirty and covered with this mud, appear tinted
with blood.</p>

<p>A sad array. We all have a dejected mien. Several
of us will not come back.</p>

<p>Four <i>poilus</i> are carrying one of our wounded. They
advance carefully. Night has fallen and the lingering
red shadows disappear from the heavens, one after the
other, darkening our march.</p>

<p>We meet General Renaux, commanding the Division,
who comes to inspect the sector.</p>

<p>Contemplating us dolefully, he said:</p>

<p>"My poor children, what a state you are in!"</p>

<p>"General," replied a <i>poilu</i>, straightening, "that is
nothing. It is we&mdash;the men of BRONZE!"</p>


<div class="right">
MAJOR HÉLY'S VISIT, EPARGES.<br />
<i>December</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>It is reception day, to-day. Major Hély of the
General Staff, after having inspected the sector, will
dine with us.</p>

<p>And so, there are fresh flowers on the table&mdash;chicken
and champagne.</p>

<p>A ray of sun is equally in the party. What luck!
The boches are quiet.</p>

<p>It is the end of the dinner.</p>

<p>Ménard brings the <i>jus</i>, excellent coffee which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
pours in the cups. The only coffee spoon makes the
rounds of the table. Ménard also deposits a dusty
bottle which we all regard in silence but with respect.</p>

<p>Captain Gunther himself will pour the precious
liquor in the little glasses&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Major Hély sips this plum nectar like a connoisseur.
He sniffs the brandy and it causes him to smack his
lips&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah! Gunther, where did you unearth this marvelous
stuff?"</p>

<p>"In a cellar of the village, under the corpse of an
old woman."</p>


<div class="right">
PRECAUTION TRENCH, EPARGES.<br />
<i>December</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>Precaution Trench leaves a memory of horror with
all those who have frequented it&mdash;. There is such an
accumulation of German and French corpses; all huddled
together, that one feels a swelling of the heart if
one remains for any length of time in this charnel-house&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But we have to put the trench in condition. With
sweeps of the shovel human arms and legs are dismembered
so that free passage may not be blocked. Legs
and bodies are, above all, difficult to disentangle&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>At night, when the earth breathes, our men faint
occasionally, and it is necessary to give them menthol-alcohol
on bits of sugar&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look, <i>mon vieux</i>, at that rotting breast&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's possible a woman, dearly loved, has been tightly
pressed against that breast there!"</p>

<p>"This man has been reported missing&mdash;he still wears
his identification tag&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps they are waiting at home for him&mdash;they
are always hoping, without doubt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Him? Ough! he's shot to hell&mdash;but&mdash;what about
her?"</p>

YOU'RE A SLACKER! EPARGES.<br />
<i>December</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>Do you believe all those who have survived this
horrible December winter, at Eparges, are martyrs?
Not at all. Listen to what I heard this morning.</p>

<p>Two sapper-miners were arguing and this is what
took place:</p>

<p>"You ought to be ashamed to be always in F gallery&mdash;it
won't be blown up by the enemy for two months.
It's always the same with you fellows who go in for
this kind of fighting&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Désiré, you're nothing but a slacker!"</p>


<div class="right">
A WALK IN THE FOG, CALONNE TRENCH.<br />
<i>December</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>There is a thick, heavy fog here this morning&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>One can stand on the parapet, where, two hours
afterwards, he would be pierced like a sieve.</p>

<p>It gives one a very curious sensation to go several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
steps in front of the trench, over the snow, to reconnoitre
the terrain ahead of us.</p>

<p>And it is quite different to inspect this sombre place
which we always see through a periscope, not knowing
what it really is.</p>

<p>Dead boughs and leaves crackle under our feet while
we move with care. There is a zig-zag path in the
wire entanglement right in front of us&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In a hollow in the terrain we discover a German
corpse, or more precisely, a skeleton dressed in an
infantryman's uniform, a rusty rifle at his side&mdash;that
is the thing in question.</p>

<p>The body must have been there a long time&mdash;&mdash;</p>


<div class="right">
THE POILU BOULEVARDIER.<br />
<i>December</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>Day has not yet come&mdash;the weather is misty, and
the rain has stopped. From time to time a rifle
shot&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>They are working lively to set a wire entanglement
between the line of craters and a support trench. It
has got to be done fast because daybreak will soon
be here. The men sense the completion of the task,
and hurry to finish it. They joke and seem to forget
they are at a place the worst on the whole front.</p>

<p>The quiet astonishes them; neither of them find it
natural&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly a heavy explosion&mdash;a great trembling and
a large spout of earth rises in the air a hundred yards
from us&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"There it is&mdash;a boche <i>camouflet</i>!"<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>At the same moment the well-known serenade&mdash;from
all sides comes a rain of projectiles: minnenwerfer,
shells and bullets. A man, wounded, cries like
an infant with its throat cut&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Expecting an attack, I shout to my <i>poilus</i>:</p>

<p>"<i>Attention!</i> keep your eyes open!"</p>

<p>Corporal Poulet replied with an inexplicable accent:</p>

<p>"That's all right; as long as your eyeglass is not
broken, everything will go well!"</p>

A POILU WEEPS, CALONNE TRENCH.<br />
<i>December</i>, 1915.<br />
</div>

<p>A beautiful day&mdash;but how cold it is!</p>

<p>From the German lines as well as our own, white
smoke curls up from wood fires.</p>

<p>The hour at which the sector becomes active has not
arrived, and I have plenty of time to make the rounds
of the first line to keep warm.</p>

<p>Poor little hill! It is barren!</p>

<p>It has been well named: "the lobster's claw." Certainly
it has the form and color. The trees are
cracked or shattered clear to the roots, because tons
of projectiles have fallen on it.</p>

<p>The view from this dominating position is really
exquisite!</p>

<p>In front of me are the heights of the Meuse, to the
left is Longeau valley, with the village of Eparges in
the bottom and the hills of Montgirmont, Eparges and
Hûres which rise on the other side.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>
<p>The hills this morning assume the unforeseen aspect
of Mediterranean imagery, red and blue, a land of
silence, as if one would find Samos and Ephesus close
by.</p>

<p>I arrive at a machine-gunner's post&mdash;the man is
alone, his comrade must be only a few steps away
from him. He is crying!</p>

<p>He was seated on the ground, his chin in his knees.
Unshaven, unkempt, he had such a pitiable face that
I sat down at his side&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He was visibly embarrassed and annoyed at having
been taken by surprise with his eyes full of tears.</p>

<p>"Good morning, <i>mon vieux</i>!"</p>

<p>"Good morning, lieutenant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How damned cold it is this morning."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Is there anything wrong?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, I assure you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can talk to me like a brother." He did not
reply.</p>

<p>"I'm hungry! It won't bother you if I have something
to eat here&mdash;sardines, a box of <i>singe</i> and some
<i>pinard</i>&mdash;you'll have a portion?"</p>

<p>At the end of a few moments we were the best
friends in the world. I knew his name, where he was
from and what he had done in the campaign.</p>

<p>"Why were you crying a moment ago when I came
up on you? You are not a man to be afraid in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>

<p>Here there is an important storehouse belonging to
the Engineers, where materials are kept, destined to
supply the sector. There is, above all, a hut where I
go to seek shelter. Since morning an icy rain has been

lamp. What luck! The warmth is soothing and
I can dry myself&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who plays chess here?"</p>

THE PRACTICAL POILU, EPARGES.<br />
<i>January</i>, 1916.<br />
</div>

<p>This episode took place at l'Eperon-des-Mitrailleuses,
which is balder than the head of our friend
Mollinié. Tons of explosives in the last few months,
have been dropped on this little sector, and the pretty
wood which runs down each side of the hill has completely
disappeared. Underground, two long galleries
of about 125 yards each are being dug to intercept
the enemy. Again we find ourselves on ground where
mining warfare progresses. The length of these galleries
renders the work extremely difficult; the air
there is bad and at the end of the tunnel our sappers
can only work for a few hours.</p>

<p>The installation of electric lights and ventilators
betters, from day to day, living conditions which exist
in these villainous holes.</p>

<p>These latter also occasion a visit from the Colonel
of Engineers, who, on a certain night, comes to inspect
the improvements. He always has a kind word for
everyone.</p>

<p>Arriving at the end of the gallery, he questions the
brave <i>poilu</i>, who, in the presence of his colonel works
with an exaggerated rapidity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"You ought to be very grateful to your lieutenant

THE LOGICAL POILU, CHEVALIERS WOOD.<br />
<i>January</i>, 1916.<br />
</div>

<p>Chevaliers Wood appears to be at the extreme ends
of the earth, so much so that one feels far away from
everything down there. The cold is dry and piercing.
Pretty, white smoke rises from the shelters, in which
are burning bright log fires. The ground, on the
outside, is covered with snow.</p>

<p>I am going back to the trenches, having at my side
a little blue devil. The <i>poilu</i> is leading a mule, a nice,
gentle mule, carrying ammunition to a machine-gun
section.</p>

<p>We passed at the side of a 75 battery, so well
<i>camouflée</i> that we had not seen it. We are just even
with it when it begins to fire.</p>

<p>The mule makes a jump and I see the moment when
our little chasseur is going to be spilled on the ground.</p>

<p>He recovers his balance and, furious, plants himself
before the animal.</p>

<p>"<i>Nom de Dieu</i>, don't you know <i>our</i> 75's?"</p>

TRAGIC COINCIDENCE, EPARGES.<br />
<i>January</i>, 1916.<br />
</div>

<p>I have spent several days at Berne on vacation.
Some hours before my departure I went into a shop
to buy a cold luncheon to take on the train.</p>

<p>Near the shop-door two elderly women were talking
in a low voice. At the moment I went out, passing
close to them, I overheard the word "Eparges." I
stopped short.</p>

<p>"Pardon, madame, well have you said 'Eparges'&mdash;I
come from there and I return! In two days I shall
be there and it startled me to hear the name pronounced
so far from that spot that I will never forget
it!</p>

<p>"Perhaps you know someone there? Tell me, I
will go and see him for you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My son, Charles, is at Eparges&mdash;his name is
Charles Dubois. He is in the 9th Engineers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Under orders from Captain Grenet, my friend; he
is a sapper-miner&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Charles is a corporal in his company."</p>

<p>"Upon my arrival at Eparges, I promise you,
madame, that I will find your son. He will be very
happy when I tell him that I saw his mother at the
precise moment she was thinking of him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the road, in the auto, which is taking me to
Mesnil-sur-les-Côtes, I think of Charles Dubois, whom
I shall easily find at the end of my journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>I will not go to bed in the shelter, without having
seen him&mdash;God knows, however, what fatigue the last
step will bring&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Alone on foot, I will make the hard trip the length
of Longeau, a brook, which was torn up enough in 1914
and the beginning of 1915.</p>

<p>During supper tête à tête with Captain Gunther,
who welcomed me heartily on my return, I am haunted
by the memory of two old ladies&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What happened in my absence?"</p>

<p>"Nothing in particular, except this morning. We
had five men buried by a <i>camouflet</i>&mdash;they began at
once to recover the bodies. All were killed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am going above to-night, with your permission&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must go to bed&mdash;you look very tired!"</p>

<p>"I have promised a woman to see her son&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will accompany you."</p>

<p>Some moments later, we began the trip, so laborious
at night, almost to the crest of Eparges.</p>

<p>At first the long path&mdash;what irony!&mdash;the length of
which was found the shelters of our sappers and from
which came at one time or another, sounds of voices.
Then we passed Sap 13, where was heard the purring
of the electric generator and the compressor.</p>

<p>Farther on is the first-aid station, where a moment
never goes by without finding wounded there&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then it is the P. C. of the colonel, where there is
always a great bustle, and where one must say to the
<i>poilu</i>,</p>

<p>"Out of the way, <i>mon petit</i>, let me pass."</p>

<p>Finally, the subterranean passage about sixty
feet in length, and we come out in a spot not so dark:
Woevre plain is down there. We turn to the right.
It is the "Ravine of Death," where trees mutilated by
projectiles are silhouetted against the night like a
band of witches.</p>

<p>One feels in this place a veritable impression of
horror&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In front, pointing into the starry heavens, the crest
of Eparges&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Laboriously we climb the hill, stopping from time
to time to get our breath. Only a few cannon and
machine guns trouble the calm of the night.</p>

<p>At last we arrive close to Grenet's shelter, where
several men formed a group along the embankment.
I called one of his sergeants whom I already knew.</p>

<p>"Do you know Charles Dubois?"</p>

<p>"Yes, lieutenant. You heard then that we recovered
his body?"</p>

<p>"He has been killed&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"This morning&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>The <i>poilu</i> turned&mdash;I saw a stretcher, a shapeless
mass covered with a blanket, two heavy shoes which
stuck out, shrouded with red soil&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It is night. I gently lift the blanket and scarcely
recognize the contour of his face&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I can hear the voice of an old woman, who says to
another:</p>

<p>"Charles is at Eparges; I am so uneasy."</p>

with difficulty because the terrain was bad. On my

out into it without sinking up to the hips!</p>

<p>The boches commenced to shell us with 150's. The
first shot fell between Montgirmont and Eparges, in
plain view, 75 to 125 yards from me. The second burst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
125 yards to the left, back of our little board chapel,
raising a great fuss.</p>

<p>The third hit ten feet from me&mdash;whack! It did not
explode, but splattered me from head to foot&mdash;I
couldn't be picked up with pincers!</p>

any good, because around him there must have been
a nice bed of mushrooms!</p>

<p>A change in the line brought us close to Herman.
The first patrol which went out crouched over to
him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Quickly one cut the buttons from his tunic&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wait," said one of the men, "he's still got his
canteen!"</p>

<p>A <i>poilu</i> easily detached it, then shook it close
to his ear&mdash;the canteen was yet half full!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He unscrewed the cover&mdash;he sniffed it. It was
brandy!</p>

<p>It is two o'clock in the morning&mdash;all the men have
retired. I have just returned from Calonne Trench
and am very tired on entering our shelter. A man&mdash;with
a sheepskin thrown over his uniform like a cape&mdash;is
waiting for me in the outer room. He is seated near
the smouldering fire. He rises quickly.</p>

<p>"Good morning, cousin&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, you here!&mdash;Speak low because the others
sleep."</p>

<p>"Yes, I learned that you were at Eparges, and obtained
permission to come and see you before going into
the trenches."</p>

<p>"What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Back of the lines I'm a color bearer, here, I am just
like the others. Very soon we are going to occupy the
craters."</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes open, <i>mon petit</i>, and don't forget
that in this damned sector you must have sang-froid
and presence of mind if you want to get out of it
alive. You must save from tears some pretty pair of
eyes&mdash;a handsome young man like yourself certainly
has a sweetheart!"</p>

<p>Two hours later a bullet penetrated his thigh while

<p>When we arrived we found him bent over his map

so bitter at Eparges. The dinner was more than perfect

<p>As we were about to leave, he commenced to undress
and with a lighted candle in hand and half-clothed,
he conducts us to our machine.</p>

<p>The boches have seen the candle and without delay
a 77 comes whistling over loudly, bursting on an empty
house in the village. The major held up his candlestick
for them to see, then extinguished it, saying:</p>

<p>"Snuff it out!"</p>

<p>In reply the boches sent over, one after the other,
three 77's which did no more damage than the first.</p>

DAY BEFORE BATTLE OF VERDUN, EPARGES.<br />
<i>February</i> 20, 1916.<br />
</div>

<p>At dawn the sky is unbroken. It is a veritable
spring day that is here! A ray of sun in this
spot&mdash;what good luck!</p>

<p>I feel this morning a delicious sense of joy and happiness
to live.</p>

<p>A <i>poilu</i>, on the board walk, said to his friend: "This
will be a great day for airplanes."</p>

<p>In effect, all morning our airplanes and those of
the enemy described, at very high altitudes, frequent
circles, recrossing the lines, girded by puffs of white
smoke of breaking projectiles.</p>

<p>In spite of the joy which filled us all, we never spoke
but of the next attack, the topic of conversation for
the past several days.</p>

<p>We were at the turning point of the war; month
after month, the ruin of the Central Empires became
more certain, each hour that passed they became more
enfeebled in human energy and in money! "<i>Parbleu</i>,"
said an officer, "their armies have been developing on
the different fronts excessively, the strain on their
troops has become very strong; and a military decision
imposes itself upon them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>They wished to hasten the end of the war and the
way to finish it is to attempt a great thrust, a decisive
thrust, a desperate thrust&mdash;the propitious time is come,
it is the moment to attack, there is not an instant to
lose!</p>

<p>It was easily determined that a formidable battle was
about to commence and that the shock would be
heavy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Here are some of the remarks that were passed back
and forth at Eparges, the eve of the battle of Verdun.
That night in the trenches there was a silence, a silence
impressive. The night was calm and starry&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">THE DAY OF <i>February</i> 21, 1916.</div>

<p>I left Eparges at six o'clock in the morning. As
before the day dawned magnificently. In a happy mood,
I start out with Dr. Nicolas to find some of my <i>poilus</i>
on the menaced front.</p>

<p>An automobile was waiting on the Mesnil-sur-les-Côtes
to take us to the north of Verdun.</p>

<p>On leaving at seven o'clock in the morning, the rumbling
of cannon, heavy and uninterrupted, was heard:
the battle of Verdun had commenced....</p>

<p>I did not intend to stop at Verdun, but on approaching
the city, I saw the civil population fleeing <i>en masse</i>
toward the country, after 380's fell at regular intervals
on the martyred city for about an hour.</p>

<p>After a short stop, I left again for Cumières and
Côte-de-l'Oie, where I also had a squad of workers.</p>

<p>Leaving Bras, it was easy to determine that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
enemy had launched his offensive on the right bank of
the Meuse.</p>

<p>As far as the eye could reach the bursting of large
projectiles was seen: they fell particularly on the forts,
on the roads, on the cantonments, on the trenches.</p>

<p>The crushing noise produced by these large <i>Marmites</i><a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
became accentuated hour by hour; a curtain
of smoke collected against the blue sky, and, with the
brightness of the day, this spectacle certainly did not
lack grandeur.</p>

<p>I still command a view of the battlefield seen from
the Côte-de-l'Oie; columns of smoke go rolling on the
banks of the Meuse. I had never seen such parallel
artillery preparation up to that day.</p>

<p>Our <i>poilus</i> cried:</p>

<p>"The 77's and 105's no longer exist!"</p>

<p>It could easily be seen that "something" was taking
place on the right bank where the intensity of the
artillery became greater hour by hour.</p>

<p>They fought stubbornly before Samonieux and we
heard the noise of the machine-guns. I made the resolution
to go and rejoin the men I had at Ornes, on
the right bank, since it was they above all that were
in the greatest danger.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The memory of the afternoon of this day will forever
remain sad; I ask myself often how my comrade
LeBlond and I had been able to reach Ornes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>We succeeded in reaching Bras toward two o'clock:
the village was violently bombarded&mdash;human bodies and
horses blocked the streets.</p>

<p>I went to pay my respects to General B&mdash;&mdash; whom
I found in his fighting post, surrounded by his officers.
He wished us good luck in affectionate terms.</p>

<p>We climbed Côte du Poivre and arrived at Louvemont
toward three o'clock in the afternoon. In going
through the village, our eyes commenced to be irritated
by tear gas: the bombardment was infernal.</p>

<p>It was apparent that the enemy was undertaking a
decisive action. The road which we traversed was hammered
by numerous projectiles and there was nothing
for us to do but forge ahead like automatons&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>LeBlond had taken my arm, and, together, it was
decided not to stop before any obstacle&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The nearer we approached Chambrettes the more
dense became the fire.</p>

<p>At four o'clock the enemy piled up a barrage on
the road and concentrated their fire on the farm: it
rained projectiles of all calibers&mdash;of all big calibers,
I know.</p>

<p>In a circle of 325 yards radius, there fell, certainly,
four <i>marmites</i> every second, of a caliber equal or superior
to 21 centimeters. The ground trembled and a
smoke, acrid and suffocating, enveloped us.</p>

<p>The 150 timed-shell from time to time rent the air
with their furious screams like those of a cat when you
step on its tail&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>During my whole campaign never have I seen an
equal density of fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Torn bodies of skirmishers were scattered here and
there in this zone of almost certain death. Continuing
our way we had escaped death more than once in this
violent fire. We were covered with spurts of earth
from bursting projectiles which fell close to us and
those that fell around struck us with ricochetting fragments
of steel.</p>

<p>As there was not urgent need of reaching Ornes, we
resolved to tarry a few instants in one of the shelters
on the farm. We had 175 yards to go in a rain of
steel and well-directed fire, or as dizzy a route as the
ascension of Mount Cervin, for example.</p>

<p>We entered the telephone post at the precise moment
the <i>poilus</i> ascertained all underground lines had been
cut&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The shells continued to fall so fast around us that
we had the impression of being on the inside of a hermetically
sealed autobus rumbling with great speed over
a rough pavement.</p>

<p>A projectile burst at one corner of the shelter which
crumbled from the force of the explosion and threw us
all together in a heap&mdash;No panic!</p>

<p>I sensed the feeling that our last hour had come and
the men, picking themselves up in silence, crowded into
the corners save one who cried, gesticulating with his
arms:</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is that what you call a demolishing fire?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our objective was Ornes and if it became necessary
to die I avowed that I would prefer to fall in the light,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
my eyes turned toward the sun. "If die we must," I
say to LeBlond, on leaving the dugout, "I would rather
be killed outside&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am with you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again we traveled over a space of 350 yards in a
haze of fire and smoke&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A <i>marmite</i> fell a few steps away, covering us with
dirt&mdash;I see my comrade stagger, struck on the head
with a large mass. Fortunately it is only a ball of
turf which knocks him violently to the ground&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He picks himself up, and in a ringing voice:</p>

<p>"Yes, if that one will not get me a vacation, now, you
will not be very <i>chic</i>!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some hours later we reached Ornes, having had to
go through the barrage at Chambrettes, and another,
of 305's, on the cavernous road along Chaume Wood.
This road, so quiet a few days before, had become a
veritable hell.</p>

<p>The village of Ornes, itself, was relatively calm that
night, the infantry attacks not having begun up to the
present, only between the Meuse and Herbebois Wood.
The <i>poilus</i> waited calmly all events that might be forthcoming,
always ready to do their duty stoically and
simply&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I had promised General B&mdash;&mdash; to give him news of
our sector during the night, all the telephonic means
of communication having been destroyed.</p>

<p>Again I traversed the entire road from Ornes to
Bras; at Chambrettes the spectacle was fairy-like&mdash;our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
batteries on the one side fired in unison and their
flashes illumined the heavens. In front of us the soaring
shells came thick and fast from the forest of Spincourt
and Forges Wood, intermittently brightening the
darkness like a luminous <i>pianotage</i>, giving one the
impression that every ten square yards there was an
enemy battery.</p>

<p>The sky was ablaze on the horizon&mdash;it was the burning
villages&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Yes, they began well the great battle, the greatest
battle in the history of the world&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">THE DAY OF <i>February</i> 22, 1916.</div>

<p>Our impressions were precise, the battle was going to
be rude. The enemy had accumulated a formidable
heavy artillery, to which it seemed impossible to respond
for the moment.</p>

<p>They sent over as many 210's as they formerly had
77's and as many 280's, 305's, 380's, and 420's as they
had 105's and 150's.</p>

<p>The men all felt immediately at the beginning of the
battle that the enemy would be stopped only by mere
brute strength&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">AT NOON IN A CELLAR IN THE VILLAGE OF CUMIÈRES.</div>

<p>During a very heavy bombardment we were lunching.
We had a basket of oysters that came from Verdun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
The merchant sold out his wares so that he could flee
with the townspeople&mdash;The city is empty.</p>

<p>"<i>Allons</i>, if the oysters last, it will be possible to withstand
the blow!&mdash;--"</p>

<div class="center">ROAD TO ORNES&mdash;NINE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT</div>

<p>The number of dead men and horses along the road
to Ornes has increased&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The intensity of enemy artillery fire has not diminished,
and the sound of the battle reaches farther to
the right&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>We pass wounded, alone or in little groups, dragging
themselves to the rear&mdash;&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">CHAUME WOOD&mdash;TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT</div>

<p>A cry!</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;help!"</p>

<p>We stopped&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>This cry is repeated several times. I enter the Wood.
Guided by the sound of the voice and climbing over
shattered and twisted trees, I end by discovering a
human form cowering in a shell-hole&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You're wounded?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in the head, the arms, in the legs and the
heart&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Mon vieux</i>, you bawl too much to be really wounded.
Get up!"</p>

<p>The unfortunate arose and I read fear in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?"</p>

<p>"From Herbebois&mdash;they attacked with their flame-throwers&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>

THE MAGNIFICENT POILU, CHAMBRETTES.<br />
<i>February</i> 22, 1916.<br />
</div>

<p>A column of infantry-munitions wagons halted at the
fork in the road from Beaumont and Ornes; a 305
shell had dug a deep crater in the road which was
cut in two.</p>

<p>These light wagons, in good order, could pass
neither to the right nor to the left of the hole on
account of wire entanglements.</p>

<p>Observed by the enemy, the convoy, after some
moments, met with a veritable rain of projectiles, time
and percussion, which fell around us.</p>

<p>Men, horses and mules were killed or wounded. A
<i>poilu</i> spontaneously took command of the column, his
immediate superiors having been killed. The beasts
reared and plunged, frightened by the flashes and explosions
which succeeded each other rapidly. The men
clinging to the bridles were killed on the spot before
they could make a move!</p>

<p>A little soldier is lifted high by his frantic mule,
which stands, straight up on its hind feet. He curses,
he yells, while the timed shell churn the air with wailings
like a dying child&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say you will not go back&mdash;at a time like this,
<i>you</i> mules <i>must</i> not go <i>back</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A few seconds later he and his mule are on the
ground, fastened, one to the other, by the bridle: the
shell which killed him has almost stripped his body
of clothes. I also was thrown to the ground, but I am
not hit&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Bending over the man, I attempt to find, but vainly,
his identification tag, so that some day the name of
this obscure hero may be known&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The mule, stretched out at full length, essays to
raise its head, still grasped by the hands of the corpse,
and gives a couple of useless kicks&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It commences to snow&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">THE DAY OF FEBRUARY 23, ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT.</div>

<p>The major, commanding Ornes, says to me:</p>

<p>"This is what must be done! Our left has completely
collapsed and we can be flanked at any moment.
I have sent a reconnaissance to Herbebois
Wood; the patrol has returned and tells me no one
is there any longer&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"As you know the sector perfectly, you must go
to Louvemont yourself to inform the Division of our
situation. Take someone with you so that if one is
killed the other can carry the information just
the same! Be careful along the Chaume Wood, because
from here to Chambrettes, you will meet up
with a boche patrol. It has now become a first-line
position. Keep your revolver in your hand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, major."</p>

<p>"Go, my friend."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

THE MATCHLESS POILUS, BEFORE CHAUME WOOD.<br />
<i>February</i> 23, 1918.<br />
</div>

<p>The road from Ornes, before Chaume Wood, has
assumed a fantastic appearance! The trees are fallen
and the branches are entangled&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The beautiful countryside has become chaotic following
this avalanche of projectiles of the preceding
days. The bombardment is always frightful. The
snow which has fallen the night before makes going
bad and one slips and stumbles incessantly. How
difficult it is to follow such a road at night when you
haven't slept for three days!</p>

<p>Again I have been made a scout and I ask myself
if I will be not soon, in my turn, one of these hideous
corpses which I pass each instant and which have
been snapped up by death along this damned road.
It seems now as if the shells were searching you out
and rifle bullets followed you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In the semi-moonlit shadow I perceive two stretcher-bearers
caught by death as they carry their wounded;
the one in the lead is on his knees, the other already
down, both clutching the handles of the litter.</p>

<p>I continue my route. Before arriving at the bifurcation
of the two roads to Ornes and Beaumont, I cannot
longer recognize my direction, so great has been
the change in the aspect of the surroundings during
the last three days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>I overtake two men who, en <i>pères peinards</i>,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> happy
at meeting someone, suggest we go together. They
walk without haste; the terrain has become very difficult
to follow and it is dark&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly one of them makes a false step, he has not
seen an immense shell-hole, and he falls forward head
first&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>His comrade, on the edge of the crater, bursts
with laughter.</p>

<p>"You're not crazy. You know well enough the subway
is closed at this time of night!"</p>

<div class="center">AT THE WEST CORNER OF CHAUME WOOD, MIDNIGHT.</div>

<p>"Who goes there?"</p>

<p>"France!"</p>

<p>Some <i>poilus</i> hastily cross a part of the trench at
the border of the Wood. The officer in command of
them is one of my old comrades at Eparges&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell me the news. How is it going?"</p>

<p>"I was going to ask the same question?"</p>

<p>"It's the third day. The attack will be held!"</p>

<p>"It's serious&mdash;but we'll get 'em. What an attack!"</p>

<p>"What a difference from Champagne!"</p>

<p>They stopped before a corpse, curled in a heap;
he had certainly fallen to-day because we had not

blackened face he might have been taken for a
negro&mdash;&mdash;</p>

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL POILU, ORNES.<br />
<i>February</i> 24, 1916.<br />

<p>It is night&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The sky is ablaze to our left. They will perhaps
attack at any moment. Shells rain around us four
at a time and at regular intervals.</p>

<p>As the positions on our left have been forced back
and our flank menaced, Chabert's sappers have hastily
dug a small trench at the entrance to the village,
facing the west.</p>

<p>The <i>poilus</i> are waiting stoically for whatever may
transpire. A man is curled up and, numb with
fatigue, sleeps. One of his companions shakes him
and says:</p>

<p>"<i>Mon vieux</i>, you cannot sleep. Wake up, because
each minute we hold them now, it is a VICTORY!"</p>


<div class="right">
WOUNDED, BEZONVAUX.<br />
<i>Night of February</i> 24-25, 1916.<br />
</div>

<p>Our artillery no longer responds. The order to
fall back was given at five o'clock. My men are moving
toward Verdun, conducted by Sergeant Thiébaut.
I stop at Bezonvaux, hoping to find there my comrade
Chabert. I have promised his mother, who has
only this boy, that I will watch over him like a
brother&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Followed by Corporal Poulet, who has remained with
me, I wander around in the violently bombarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
village. I enter the empty homes abandoned by their
inhabitants, where our poor soldiers, tired out and
saying nothing, lie stretched out on the floors. The
big <i>marmites</i> arrive at regular intervals, crushing
houses and occupants&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Finally I end by discovering one of Chabert's sappers
and say to him:</p>

<p>"Where is your lieutenant? Take me to him!"</p>

<p>"I don't know where he is&mdash;I believe he has been
killed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The night is black and the air is filled with smoke
and dust. One stumbles above all on plaster and
bricks&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Sinister detonations and cries and groans. There
is, in the air, the breath of catastrophe, yes, of catastrophe,
which oppresses your chest.</p>

<p>The man who guides us is lost&mdash;he goes and comes,
he makes us take wide detours, he is afraid and is
nervous&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A large projectile falls at our side&mdash;the <i>poilu</i> is
knocked down, giving vent to a raucous cry as he falls.
I fall myself to my knees and feel the heat of blood
which runs down my chest. My left hand rests on the
body of the sapper and I am conscious of it covered
with warm blood&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Poulet raises me up, giving me a drink of brandy.
Stray bullets whistle around us&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I am only slightly wounded and take Poulet's arm
to direct ourselves toward Fort Douaumont where I
will have it dressed.</p>

<p>How long and sad is this road. It is a veritable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>

days have proven almost too much&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lieutenant, why doesn't our artillery respond any
more?" Poulet asked me several times.</p>

<p>"I do not know, <i>mon petit</i>, we are going through
grave times, but we must not get discouraged. Have
confidence!"</p>

<p>Someone who must be amazed is the surgeon-in-chief
of Gondrecourt!</p>

<p>I arrived at his hospital in the early morning in
Colonel Gency's automobile, who announced my coming
by telephone&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A hospital attendant tore off my tunic, cut off my
shirt, baring a bloody chest&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are going to give you an anti-tetanus injection,

myself and left&mdash;English fashion. Luckily Colonel
Gency's automobile was still there. I had no fear of
pain, or the boches, but I don't like doctors!</p>

<p>I went through Cumières like a shooting star would

where I know they will not come to search

FEAR, CUMIÈRES.<br />
<i>February</i> 25, 1916.<br />
</div>

<p>Fear ... Oh! terrible thing! It is a contagious
malady that has to be watched. All of us have inside
a cowardly beast that awakens sometimes at the approach
of danger&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Very violent bombardment to-day. The two
chauffeurs who brought me here this morning left the
machine at the entrance to the village. On returning
from Côte-de-l'Oie I found them in a sappers' bombardment
shelter where they sought refuge.</p>

<p>These men are green and grumble about things.
Around them are some <i>poilus</i> and a captain. The
explosions outside redouble and I feel as if the whole
world was ill at ease.</p>

<p>The two automobilists, to put on a bold front,
speak of their machine "which must be demolished by
this time" or "which must have been torn to pieces
long ago," and by the trembling of their voices I divine
that they are thinking of themselves in speaking of
the "automobile."</p>

<p>Little by little the others chatted about the effect
of the bombardment and they discovered that the
dugout was not very solid and that an accident could
easily happen. The captain appeared to me nervous
and at once I felt that strange thing burning within
me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>This anguish that grew inside is perhaps the result
of these last days of fatigue during which we had not
been able to rest an instant, day or night. It is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
perhaps, the result of my wound of last night which still
bleeds and makes my shirt stick to my body&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>No, it is these two cowards, these two birds of bad
luck that make us shiver&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>At such times "you have got to kill fear," or one
is lost. The means? Get out of this hole! the pretext&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I found it when the two chauffeurs recommenced
their old story:</p>

<p>"Oh! our machine&mdash;how it is being riddled!"</p>

<p>"You," I said to him, "you sicken me with your
machine. I'll wager that there is nothing the matter
with it. Go and see and we'll find out for certain!
It is not an order that I give you, but only that when
the question is settled in your mind, you will leave us
in peace&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The cannonade grew worse at this moment and there
was a literal downpour of shells in the village&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are not going? Then I'm going myself&mdash;and
at least I will not have to listen to you any
longer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I started toward the stairs when I heard LeBlond's
voice in back of me, which said:</p>

<p>"You are crazy&mdash;you have vowed to get killed&mdash;it
is suicide&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I looked him in the eyes, to the depth of his soul,
and murmured:</p>

<p>"I've got to&mdash;I want to go. Stay here!"</p>

<p>I went out. Nothing was said, but all looked at
me, stupefied&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ah! <i>mes enfants</i>, how it fell!</p>

<p>When I took the first steps outside my legs trembled
and I believed I would be incapable of accomplishing
the task I had imposed upon myself. Fear shook me.
I walked along the street. Gradually I felt stronger.
Suddenly, after a few minutes' walk, I felt as calm as
if I had been walking along a promenade at Nice&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Despite the flurry, the smoke and brick dust which
I had to breathe, I continued the route, taking pleasure
in my folly, experiencing an unhealthy and dangerous
joy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Soon, I found myself at the side of the machine
which had not been touched, but an unexploded 100-shell
was half buried on its flank&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I lifted the shell out and, carrying it in my arms,
took the road for the shelter. The returning was
effected like my going, through a cloud of dust and
smoke of bursting projectiles. Never had a walk done
me so much good and when I entered the dugout with
my "precious souvenir" I thought:</p>

<p>"This time I am armored!"</p>

<p>I walked through the group of men and deposited
the shell on the captain's table.</p>

<p>"What was that you said? You are both chumps
and your machine is uninjured, but I found this alongside
of it. I make you a present of it so it will be
a reminder of to-day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And immediately they smiled and became themselves
again&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It is night, but a terrible night&mdash;the battle is unchained.
The heavens, black as ink, are brightened
each instant by the flashes of explosions.</p>

<p>German shells which fall in the city make a louder
noise than during the preceding days, as if they broke
in a cellar&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Not a cry&mdash;not a wail&mdash;stoicism&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>On the roads around the city there is a great bustle
of camions, gun carriages and caissons. Then there
is the hasty shuffling of troops going into action to-night,
and who will relieve their comrades holding the
line over there.</p>

<p>All these movements are made silently, without
cries, without useless words, but everything moves
rapidly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I direct myself toward the city, when suddenly a
small machine stops at my side. A man of athletic
stature, who was seated at the chauffeur's side, jumps
lightly out of the machine and approaches me.</p>

<p>He flashes his electric pocket lamp, no doubt to see
who I am. At first I had taken him for an Englishman,
by reason of his khaki uniform.</p>

<p>I said this with such an accent of chagrin and almost
of despair, that he broke into a loud laugh.</p>

<p>"No, not <i>cassé</i>, but K. of C.," and he held up his
sleeve on which were found the two letters.</p>

<p>He then spoke volubly enough in English, of which
I could not understand a single word, but which certainly
must have been of lively interest, to judge by
the heat of his discourse. Fortunately he continued
in French:</p>

<p>"Lost the road&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

you&mdash;&mdash;Thiébaut, take these gentlemen to Fort
Souville, by the Etain road&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you!"</p>

<p>"One second! I wish I could talk English so that
I could commend you for what you are doing. Then,
you Americans have crossed the ocean to mix in this
hell and to succor our wounded&mdash;&mdash;Wait! You are

<p>An uninterrupted file of camions extends from
Bar-le-Duc to Verdun. It is like an endless chain
which never stops day or night.</p>

<p>A <i>poilu</i>, who is breaking stones in the road, says to

THE SUMMIT OF DEAD MAN'S HILL.<br />
<i>March</i> 2, 1916.<br />
</div>

<p>There is nothing to say, but we desired to keep in
touch with some <i>poilus</i> in a bombardment dugout 225
yards from the spot where we now are. The communicating
trench is blocked up and it is in full view that
we have to leap over this stretch of ground&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It was toward the end of the day, but one could yet
see very well. Scarcely had we gone a step along the
road to Béthincourt than Guéneau, LeBlond and myself
were seen by the boches. They turned their cannon
and machine-guns on us&mdash;yes, three 105's which came
over seemed deposited by hand. The first covered us
with earth at some yards to our left; the second fell
a short distance to the right on the edge of the road.</p>

<p>"Let's get out of here, <i>les copains</i>,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> fifty yards
farther&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>In a few bounds we were away from that dangerous
spot. The third shell burst, in effect, exactly on the
place we had just left&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>We are at this instant at the point where the road
from Béthincourt starts to the top of Dead Man's
Hill. A little wagon is turned upside-down, with the
stiffened remains of the horse and its swollen belly still
in the shafts.</p>

<p>We just had time to crawl into a shell-hole behind
the carcass which hid us from the enemy and served
as a shield. Our protector gave off nauseating puffs
of a very rich scent:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>
<p>"It is <i>drôle</i>," observed Guéneau, "that Dead Man
is nothing but a rotting horse!"</p>

that man be that heartless he can

MY ORDERLY HABERT, VERDUN.<br />
<i>March</i>, 1916.<br />
</div>

<p>I have just returned from Verdun, worn out by
fatigue, at the beginning of the afternoon, with the idea
of getting a few hours sleep in the silent and empty
house of Monsieur Louis. Habert, alone, had not left
it. I had taken him as an orderly for the reason he
was the father of five children. Besides, he is not a
warrior and it is plainly uncomfortable for him to
wait on us when the shells break around <i>Rue sur-l'eau</i>.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>I am dying with envy to get into bed. I climb the
stairs to the first floor where the bed is made. Habert
has found a pretext not to accompany me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The shells whistled angrily and fell thick and fast
on the city. They seemed to say: "Ah! you wish to
sleep&mdash;but just try it." At the end of a few seconds
I slept profoundly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>What good sleep, what a deep sleep, during which
Death itself would come without one knowing it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I had, nevertheless, the vague sensation of having
been shaken and left dizzy by an explosion that prevented
my making a movement. I finished by opening
my eyes. The room was yet filled with dust and smoke;
the window frame and part of the wall were thrown
on the quilt! It was with difficulty that I could extricate
myself and I shouted:</p>

<p>"Habert! Habert!"</p>

<p>Not a reply&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<p>Immediately I imagined that the poor boy had been
killed. My clothes had been scattered around the room
and I descended the stairs four at a time without taking
the time to even put on my trousers&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Habert! Habert!"</p>

<p>He wasn't in the dining-room, nor in the kitchen
where there were some broken glasses&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I opened the cellar door. The rascal was behind it
with a bottle of my prune brandy in one hand and a
little glass in the other&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Nom de Dieu!</i> I catch you at it! You carry away
and drink my prune brandy while your lieutenant is
shelled in bed. To-morrow you will go into the first-line
trenches, <i>misérable</i>&mdash;to the trenches, you understand
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I read in his mocking eyes with his half-penitent
air:</p>

<p>"I'm easy about it, you like my chicken fricassée too
well."</p>


<div class="right">
A REGAL DINNER, VERDUN.<br />

</div>

<p>"Habert, we have as guests to-night, two colonels!
Dinner on the table at seven o'clock and let everything
be perfect.</p>

<p>"Your assistant and yourself will be in white from
head to foot: breeches, jacket, socks, shoes and white
gloves."</p>

<p>"Good, lieutenant."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is not all&mdash;wait before you speak&mdash;rice
powder on your hair, so that it will all be regal&mdash;your
hair well combed. Have you got a comb?"</p>

<p>"Yes, lieutenant."</p>

<p>"By the way, you have never told me&mdash;do you know
how to use a tooth brush?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To shine the brass?"</p>

<p>"They use them also for other things&mdash;I want a
candelabrum on the table and have the candlesticks
polished. Now for the menu&mdash;No, I forgot the flowers.
You will find them in the basket that came from Bar-le-Duc
with the provisions&mdash;Where was I?"</p>

<p>"The menu, lieutenant."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. Appetizers&mdash;four or five different kinds&mdash;oysters,
tomato soup, grilled sole, chicken fricassée&mdash;your
specialty&mdash;goose livers and romaine salad, fruit,
dessert, coffee.</p>

<p>"Wine! The best that <i>père</i> Louis has left us&mdash;with
the goose livers, the champagne&mdash;with coffee my prune
brandy, but be ready and if I call you be prompt. A
roaring fire on the hearth&mdash;Good!"</p>

<p>"Lieutenant, I do not believe that will be enough&mdash;I
would serve a steak before the chicken&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the appointed time we go to search for Colonels
Peigné and Benoit, who have not left the cellars in the
Citadel since the beginning of the offensive, that is to
say for three weeks&mdash;and they underwent a nerve-racking
siege of it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>We brought them through the city and then "home"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
by the <i>Rue-sur-l'eau</i>. During the meal we thanked them
several times for having accepted our modest repast so
graciously.</p>

<p>Ah! Our "modest dinner!" And we all "vaccinated
the tomato" as Habert called it. Soon there was no
thought of bombardment and all the preoccupations&mdash;What
a feast!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They spoke of it a long time, it appears, in the humid
cellars of the Citadel....</p>


<div class="right">
THE PILLAGER, VERDUN.<br />
<i>March</i>, 1916.<br />
</div>

<p>It is night! I have just walked through Verdun,
which is always being bombarded. As I was passing
in front of a house, I heard a noise inside, the door
was half-open&mdash;I entered the hallway&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In the bedroom at the side there was a series of
loud noises as if someone was trying to move furniture&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I open the door. I flash my electric torch and perceive
a soldier lugging a large wooden chest like a common
house thief.</p>

<p>He has not seen me, but turns brusquely at the flash
of the light. He is kneeling on the floor and regards
me fixedly.</p>

<p>"What are you doing there? Surely it is your sister's
house or you wouldn't be kneeling that way! Perhaps
I interrupt you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>He shot me a wicked glance and looked furious at
having been caught in flagrant wrong.</p>

<p>"That's not right, what you're doing there, no, it's
not right."</p>

<p>"I do nothing wrong, I came here to sleep for a few
hours on a bed!"</p>

<p>"In the meanwhile you make enough clatter to wake
the neighbors, if there are any, and visit the storeroom&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm doing nothing wrong, I assure you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We will talk it over! I am wondering why I didn't
blow out your brains when I found you pillaging the
home of poor people&mdash;Here you soil the glory and
honor of your comrades. Go! you disgust me!"</p>

<p>"Me also, I have been through hell like the others,
and perhaps to-morrow I shall be killed&mdash;yes, I will be
killed, I swear it. I'm honest&mdash;I no longer know what
I'm doing. It's true it's not right. What must I do?
I've seen all sides of it&mdash;I know no more. Arrest me&mdash;here
I am!"</p>

<p>"Go join your comrades! Go quick. You have time
to make reparation&mdash;you know what. This secret will
rest between you and me. Now go!"</p>

<p>The man took himself away without daring to look
back and I watched him disappear into the night&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>To-day I returned to Verdun, and LeBlond and I
have taken a rest in the comfortable home of M. and
Mme. Louis.</p>

<p>These worthy persons quit the city with the former's
sister, Mme. Joannie, and Habert, our orderly, watches
the premises.</p>

<p>We have just received a letter from Mme. Joannie
dated at Bar-le-Duc, recounting at length her terror
and vexation happily over. She must have left so precipitously
the necessaries and also the superfluities!
She requested us to make a visit to her room and forward
the more important objects we should come
across.</p>

<p>We then entered her room and apart from a few
broken glasses everything was still arranged as it was
on the day of her departure. Dresses, trinkets, yellow
photographs, stuffed animals, dignifiedly seemed to be
awaiting her return&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In a corner of the sideboard&mdash;her false teeth! Poor,
poor Mme. Joannie, you must have been afraid to have
abandoned them!</p>

<p>"She was afraid of swallowing them," said Habert,
between his teeth.</p>

<p>A 105 arrived, breaking a few yards from him, a
large fragment skidded on the ground, hitting him on
the head&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I see the man make a bound and fall flat on the
ground&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>With his two hands he tears off his blue helmet,

an absent and gloomy look. My attention had been
drawn immediately by the expression of despair which
one could easily read on his features. I lowered my

He cannot enjoy himself and laugh like the others?

TAVANNES TUNNEL.<br />
<i>March</i> 15, 1916.<br />
</div>

<p>Tavannes Tunnel, everyone will tell you, leaves a
memory of hell. It constitutes a natural shelter for
troops in reserve in the sector of Vaux. The enemy
bombarded the extremities of the Tunnel with gas shell
and those of a large caliber&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>During the long months we had dead piled up at
the entrance to these villainous holes, because access
was had by means of two passageways, opening to
the sky, with each side of the rocky walls very
abrupt&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>When shells burst in this limited space, it was impossible
to get under cover and the corpses of our dead
accumulated at the two outlets of the Tunnel!</p>

<p>Those who met in Tavannes Tunnel must have hated
the spot. They groped around blindly awaiting anything!</p>

<p>At times, I believed myself that I would be one of
these kind of bugs, black and stinking, that one crushed
under foot!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day the moment arrived to send re-inforcements
to a place very near there. There was nothing to
say but get going immediately! A sergeant took command
of the little column&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Forward, <i>mes enfants</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The cannonade raged and it was "bad" outside&mdash;The
150 timed-shell and the big 210 percussion shell
followed each other rapidly, searching out the more
nervy ones&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The sergeant left the Tunnel first, briskly ascending
the incline, believing he was followed by his men. He
turns and perceives they are not there&mdash;yet!</p>

<p>"<i>Nom de Dieu!</i> what are you doing, you laggards!
Are you coming to-day or to-morrow!"</p>

<p>They came out, the <i>poilus</i>, but with head and back
bent as if under a shower of rain. They hurried, without
precipitation, because of the steep climb. Now
that they have left the Tunnel, they are all right&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>They creep along worm-like and the file of men, like
beads on a rosary, extends from the entrance to the
Tunnel to the waiting sergeant.</p>

<p>Suddenly an explosion, flurry, smoke&mdash;right in their
midst, <i>les pauvres</i>!</p>

<p>For some instants they all disappear in the cloud&mdash;but
there is "horizon blue," crumpled bodies and a
spinning helmet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Finally the cloud clears away; there are still some
men around him and the sergeant shouts again:</p>

<p>"<i>Nom de Dieu!</i> you laggards! Are you coming to-day
or to-morrow!"</p>

<p>They hurry on, striding over the bodies of their
comrades who have fallen&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>To-night we sent one of our men to the Citadel of
Verdun to send a package of papers to Colonel Benoit.</p>

<p>We were at table&mdash;Habert lighted the lamp and
night had fallen. Our orderly had scarcely placed the
rabbit stew on the table than three violent raps were
heard at the door.</p>

<p>An old Territorial, with a dejected air, entered the
dining-room, and we saw by his bearing he came to
announce a misfortune&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you Lieutenant Capart?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

your name was seen at the top of the papers and I
brought them to you."</p>

<p>"Our sapper has been killed! How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"The shell struck him squarely, killing three other
<i>poilus</i>. He is in shreds, lieutenant. Good night,
lieutenant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>LeBlond and I were astounded at the death of this
brave boy, who had just left us. With sadness we
turned over the papers in his handwriting and covered
with his blood. Habert's features were pale and dejected.</p>

<p>The news extinguished our appetites and we sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
gloomy and silent before the excellent meal Habert had
prepared for us&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An hour later one of our <i>poilus</i> arrived by the <i>Rue-sur-l'eau</i>,
and said to us:</p>

<p>"You know the news?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we have heard the sad thing&mdash;<i>Pauvre

<p>"He sends his respects to you, lieutenant, and asks
if you have received your papers all right&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Voyons, voyons</i>&mdash;whom are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;about your secretary&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We were just informed he had been killed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, lieutenant! he was slightly wounded in the arm
and will be away a few days on leave. These Territorials

of the great war. On October 24, 1916, he flew over
Fort Douaumont with Major Armengaud at the precise
moment the poilus swarmed over it after eight
months' of incessant battle. The first men who entered
Douaumont were the same sappers of the 19th Company,
2nd Engineers, with whom the author fought at

STORY OF A PAIR OF BOOTS, BAR-LE-DUC.<br />
<i>June</i> 6, 1916.<br />
</div>

<p>I have just dined with General Pétain. I find myself
in the little home of M. and Mme. Lévy, where
I have put up during the last days of our sojourn
in this city.</p>

<p>I occupy a pretty room looking out on the garden,
at which I look every morning on awakening&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Seated on my bed, I do not think of sleep, but let
my thoughts wander, fixedly regarding the flame of my
candle!</p>

<p>All at once my eyes rest on the new boots which I
have bought the same morning in Paris.</p>

<p>I begin to laugh. It had been very apparent to me
that all my comrades had admired them&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Yes, I recall, when the general was talking to me,
I heard one of them say to the other:</p>

<p>"What wonderful boots!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That is not all! I got ready for bed&mdash;From to-morrow
a new life opened for me&mdash;I began with the
boots.</p>

<p>I unlaced them, but perceived with despair that, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
spite of energetic efforts, I could not pull them off my
feet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Unnerved and swearing like a madman, using the
furniture as a buttress, I painfully succeeded in getting
one off&mdash;but the other? Impossible!</p>

<p>This damned boot did not seem to understand&mdash;I
heard a noise in the room above. Decidedly it is M.
and Mme. Lévy who are frightened!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next day at seven o'clock in the morning, my
orderly, Lefèvre, entered my room. He opened his
mouth very wide on finding his lieutenant in a pretty
white bed, a leg swinging over the side with a new
boot on it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Capart!"</p>

<p>I turned around. It is <i>he</i>! I saluted respectfully.</p>

<p>"Are you settled?"</p>

<p>"Yes, general. I am glad for this opportunity
alone to tell you how grateful I am for having been
appointed by you. You can count on me no matter
what circumstance. Ask of me what you will, my life
belongs to you, general, I give it to you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

THE REGIMENT WHICH PASSES, NETTANCOURT.<br />
<i>July</i>, 1916.<br />
</div>

<p>The sun has just come up&mdash;I open my eyes. I am
not wrong, it is the blowing of bugles that wakens
me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I jump out of bed and fling the large window clear up&mdash;my
room is flooded with light&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It is a regiment which is passing&mdash;it comes straight
from Dead Man's Hill. Our <i>poilus</i> are tanned, but
their faces are worn&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"My poor <i>poilus</i>, your uniforms are covered with
dry mud, but you are magnificent&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The band plays "Sambre and Meuse" and I am so
affected that I throw myself on the bed and sob like
a child.</p>


<div class="right">
A LITERAL TRANSLATION, CAMP MAILLY.<br />
<i>July</i>, 1916.<br />
</div>

<p>I was assisting at some trench-mortar tests which
have lasted several days. The President of the Republic,
accompanied by a large suite, honored us by his
visit to-day.</p>

<p>The camp presented an extremely unique aspect by
reason of the great number of Russian officers and
men, which one sees everywhere.</p>

<p>Out of consideration for the visit of M. Poincaré,
a Russian Battalion gave an exhibition drill. When
the President passed it in review, the Slavic troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
became clamorous. They shouted in Russian something
which must have meant:</p>

<p>"Long live the President of the French Republic."</p>

<p>From their gestures one of our <i>poilus</i> was explaining
the meaning to one of his comrades in back of me.</p>

<p>"Hear what the Russians said to the President:</p>

<p>"'You have seen me in the little bar around the
corner.'"</p>


<div class="right">
AS THEY GO, A LITTLE VILLAGE IN THE ARGONNE.<br />
<i>August</i>, 1916.<br />
</div>

<p>The priest of R&mdash;&mdash; has invited me to have coffee
with him. The kindly old man saw the German invasion
in 1914. He had been rudely treated in his native
hamlet, and he appeared&mdash;when one saw the ruins&mdash;to
have had many days of grief. Two days of battle and
this was all he knew of war!</p>

<p>The boches, on retiring, had set fire to four corners
of the village and everything had been burned, save
his church where he permitted some German wounded
to seek shelter.</p>

<p>Our troops triumphantly entered the smoking ruins
of the village at night&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"My brave boys," the priest said to them, "I embrace
you and thank God&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The <i>poilus</i>, stirred with the feverish lust of pursuit,
demanded:</p>

<p>"Any Germans here?"</p>

<p>One of the men, gone completely mad, shouted:</p>

<p>"Where are they? I'll stick this bayonet through
'em&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Then someone said:</p>

<p>"There are wounded in the church."</p>

<p>"I pleaded with them," the old priest said.</p>

<p>"My children, they are our enemies, but respect the
wounded!"</p>

<p>"The wounded!" roared the other, "the wounded!
I'll cut 'em to pieces!"</p>

<p>"They all followed me like a pack of hounds," the
priest went on, "and I prayed to God for aid.</p>

<p>"The first one we saw, on entering the church, was
a Bavarian stretched out in a pool of blood. Rolling
his eyes up at me, he muttered:</p>

<p>"'A drink&mdash;I'm thirsty&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'<i>Nom de Dieu</i>, father, so you let your wounded die
of thirst&mdash;that's a rotten trick! Here! drink this&mdash;you!'

boche&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

THE EVE OF THE RECAPTURE OF FORT DOUAUMONT.<br />
<i>October</i> 23, 1916.<br />
</div>

<p>Major Armengaud and I left Nettancourt this morning
by airplane to assist in the operations about to
be unloosed before Verdun.</p>

<p>The weather is uncertain and some large running
clouds are above us. Before landing at Lemme, it had
been decided that we would make a short incursion
over the lines&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Here is the Meuse! The two banks of the battlefield
appear to me yellowish gray with the Douaumont
Hill tinted red.</p>

<p>The cannonade is raging&mdash;I see the vivid flashes of
shells leaving the guns and I hear loud detonations
above the noise of the motor&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 494px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>
<p>The weather is very nasty! Always it is the same
thing. It will surely rain to-night!</p>

<p>We flew above St. Michel Hill at the moment when
our 400 shell fell on Douaumont and on Vaux, throwing
up columns of earth and smoke.</p>

<p>From Fort Douaumont rise big voluted shafts of
smoke. Fortunately our artillerymen had found the
joint in the armor&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Not a boche <i>avion</i> in the air. What matter! This
spectacle is so thrilling, that, for the moment, my
machine-gun gets very little use&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The <i>poilus</i> themselves must be there in the trenches,
waiting the hour of attack. I cannot see them, but
my heart and thoughts go out to them.</p>

<p>I had the impression from that very moment the
recapture of Fort Douaumont was certain&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>We landed in about an hour without a single incident&mdash;&mdash;</p>


<div class="right">
DOUAUMONT.<br />
<i>October</i> 24, 1916.<br />
</div>

<p>It is maddening. It is raining. At the aviation
field where I am, everybody is effervescent. The first
results of the day are magnificent, the <i>poilus</i> advanced
along the entire line!</p>

<p>Unluckily it is necessary to renounce any thought
of flying and the attendant consternation is general.
Some "cuckoos" essayed to go up in the driving rain.
They kept close to earth&mdash;they flew blindly and were
shot at a few times&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>We must remain inactive and powerless all day, when
the others are participating in the fête!</p>

<p>Toward two-thirty o'clock the dark clouds in the
south, part&mdash;&mdash;The "cuckoos" leave their hangars,
although many of the pilots are skeptical of the
weather&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>At three-fifteen a blue canopy in the heavens&mdash;at
last! The whirring drowns everything&mdash;everyone hurries&mdash;one
after the other they shoot out and take the
air. Soon, perhaps, it will be too late&mdash;&mdash;After
having described a large circle over the field to gain
altitude, they leave in groups, going northward&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Major Armengaud and I have decided to leave in our
turn. I am really thrilled, I avow, at the idea of
flying during the battle&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some instants after, roads, flat stretches, forests,
flit by beneath us. At the end of ten minutes' flight,
we were in a rather thick mist&mdash;but what matter&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>We fly over the Meuse to the north of Verdun&mdash;we
are 4,000 feet high and penetrate a thick cloud.
We reach clear space. The air is full of <i>avions</i>&mdash;there
are more than eighty! <i>Chasse</i> squadrons cross
the horizon. The "sausages" are all up as usual.
The sky is marvelous. There are vacant spaces of
gilded light to our left&mdash;Verdun is somewhat in the
haze. To the north the sky is clear&mdash;I see the most
gorgeous spectacle that my eyes have ever beheld!
The cannonade thunders and a thousand flashes burst
from the mouths of our guns. Our exploding projectiles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
form a regular and mobile parabola, marking
the advance of our troops&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The enemy reacts but feebly and his barrage is laid
down over our old lines. Shell-holes filled with water
appear like cups brimming with molten gold! To the
west the sky is reddish scarlet; to the east all is steel
blue&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>We return closer to earth. Our barrage has gone
beyond Fort Douaumont&mdash;our 400's are still breaking
on Fort Vaux; great columns of dirt rise more than
125 yards in height&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Douaumont is ours!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I jumped straight up in my seat; I laughed, I
shouted, I wept&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Two <i>avions</i> flew very low. The daring Captain de
Beauchamp soared over the du Hély ravine; it looked
as if we would skid along the ground&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>We circled over the battlefield like a great bird that
has discovered its prey and is ready to sweep on it!</p>

<p>The <i>poilus</i> themselves, whom we regarded as the
messengers of victory, swarmed around the superstructure
of the Fort and signaled us! They waved
their handkerchiefs and flapped their great-coats like
birds' wings in order that we might recognize them.</p>

<p>I frequently turned to Major Armengaud, shouting:</p>

<p>"Douaumont, Douaumont is ours!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Suddenly our motor became silent&mdash;Armengaud
tapped me on the shoulder. I turned and he cried:</p>

<p>"We must land!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>We were at that moment at a fixed altitude and I
saw Armengaud twist to the right and to the left in the
fuselage, looking for a safe spot to land&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>All at once the wind whistled loudly and we assumed
a dangerous slant. At certain moments the
machine rocked&mdash;it did not seem to be going ahead&mdash;then
it recovered its nose.</p>

<p>"I do not see a place to put it!" Armengaud cried:</p>

<p>"Douaumont, Douaumont is ours!"</p>

<p>It did not matter to me, although we fell; it was
perhaps death, but&mdash;Douaumont was ours!</p>

<p>The ground seemed to approach very rapidly;
Major Armengaud guided his airplane toward a little
prairie north of Dugny, bordered by two gullies. We
landed easily on the ground, but our "cuckoo" broke
a hidden telephone wire&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Hein!</i> what do you think about it, Capart?"</p>

<p>"What a spectacle&mdash;you're an ace, major!"</p>

<p>I jumped at the same moment under the fuselage
to connect the telephone wire he had cut. At the same
time the major examined his motor&mdash;it was a trivial
matter and soon repaired!</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour we got the motor running
and once more rose in the air.</p>

<p>Darkness fell and the atmosphere was biting cold.
The wind sang in the wings of the machine. When we
reached the environs of Lemme, above the forest, it
seemed as if we were standing still. It became more
and more obscure and I asked myself how we could
land. It was black below, but, here, it seemed as if
we flew through a sea of blue. The woods appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
a sombre tint and the mist which clung to the branches
looked like clusters of fleece on Christmas trees&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The little lights underneath us flickered one after
the other, enlivening the vista more and more as they
grew more numerous. Streams of camions on the different
roads resembled long, phosphorescent worms&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Masses of clouds, strung out like attenuated lawn
veils, fluttered quickly past, between us and the ground,
completing the fantastic sketch&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I turned yet again. Back of us, one could still
perceive the last scintillations of the battle! The
bursting shell, which we heard no longer, became long,
vivid flames that rose above the horizon&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During those hours I experienced the most stirring
moments of my life, and one of the greatest epochs
in the history of the world! Thanks, dear bird!</p>

<p>We arrived above the aviation field; the major
shouted at me:</p>

<p>"Lean over to the right and keep your eyes
open&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>We watched the ground closely so as not to be
smashed. What matter, once more, because we are still
under the spell of the sight we have just seen&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Descending slowly, our eyes commenced to be accustomed
to this obscurity. We recognized the contour
of the field, and our old "cuckoo" dropped gently
on earth&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And that's how we assisted in the recapture of Fort
Douaumont!</p>

10,000 FEET, VADELAINCOURT.<br />
<i>October</i> 25, 1916.<br />
</div>

<p>To-day I went up on a rocket test at a very high
altitude. Suddenly one of the rockets burst in the
propeller, and it snapped like a pistol shot&mdash;the horizontal
rudder also was damaged&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The descent commenced by great jerks and it seemed
as if the machine would collapse and fall apart&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Flameng, my pilot, made a sign "that it could go
very bad with us&mdash;&mdash;" We went through a great
cloud and I began to believe we would crash to earth.
Despite three accidents in two days, this will be very
pretty, I say to myself. I thought that after what
I had seen these last three months, it would be absolutely
idiotic to die in a bed, and I began to laugh at
the idea&mdash;&mdash;</p>

them, the three characteristic specimens of a bygone
age, more fanciful than Nature herself!</p>

<p>I pointed my finger toward the ground so that
Major Armengaud might see them also. He looked

GENERAL GOURAUD'S POILU, CHAMPAGNE.<br />
<i>December</i>, 1916.<br />
</div>

<p>General Gouraud, when speaking of his
<i>poilus</i>, never fails to tell the following story:
"It was during a violent bombardment&mdash;The
men are in their dugouts, save only the lookouts&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"One of them, every time a shell broke near him,
responded with a shot from his rifle, so that several
times his comrades, passing by the opening in the
shelter, got ready to dash out, believing the enemy was
attacking. Finally they shouted at him:</p>

<p>"'<i>Nom de Dieu</i>, what do you mean by shooting like
that with your rifle&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Eh! <i>les vieux</i>, I'm laying down a barrage!'"</p>

NENETTE AND RINTININ! CHÂLONS-SUR-MARNE.<br />
<i>March</i>, 1917.<br />
</div>

<p>"The morale of our <i>poilus</i>," cried our comrade
Delormes, "is simply magnificent!" I have just bought
some writing paper at the store of <i>petite Antoinette</i>,
who was literally jubilant the moment I entered her
shop. She received a letter from her husband, who is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
fighting on Maisons-de-Champagne Hill. She made me
read the missive, which I would like to see awarded
a prize by the Academy:</p>

<p>"Do not worry, my Nenette," it read, "we will beat
these brutes! Here, our bowels are firm! But what
we are doing to <i>them</i>! But above all, don't worry!"</p>

<p>It was signed "Rintintin!"</p>


<div class="right">
AT THE HOSPITAL OF CHAUMONT-SUR-ÈRES.<br />
<i>March</i>, 1917.<br />
</div>

<p>The poor boy will suffer no longer&mdash;he passed away
quietly. The nurse is bent over him, and, one after
the other, closes his eyes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She is deeply moved on seeing her <i>poilu</i> go! This
exquisite creature, wife of one of our comrades, loves
her wounded with all her soul!</p>

<p>Her last one arrived in terrible shape. She remained
at his side night and day. Two times he was operated
on. At times he was better, at times worse. During
his first moment of consciousness, he asked that his
wife be summoned&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>What difficulty she had in obtaining a complete address
and formulating a telegram according to his
wishes! Then he murmured:</p>

<p>"She will not arrive too late?"</p>

<p>The nurse had written:</p>

<p>"Your husband is gravely wounded; come quick, but
hope for the best."</p>

<p>What a painful journey she would have to endure!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>During these days she learned a little more of the
life of this man. Every minute she went to see if the
wife had not come. She returned close to him.</p>

<p>"Be assured, <i>mon brave</i>, you will get better. She will
come. One travels with difficulty these days&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She exaggerated the slowness of travel and he accepted
what she told him; but he whispered:</p>

<p>"Urge her, madame, to come more quickly!"</p>

<p>Then she became impatient&mdash;Why did she not come?
Some instants after she pitied her: surely she must
have had great obstacles&mdash;some grim sentinel must have
stood in her way&mdash;and she might have fallen angry herself
thinking of these things.</p>

<p>She often interrogated the doctor and told him very
softly:</p>

<p>"I wish she would come right away!"</p>

<p>She knew that the wife of her <i>poilu</i> had three babies
to care for&mdash;What a catastrophe in this poor laborer's
home if he never returned.</p>

<p>Soon she knew there was no longer any hope. "At
least," she said to the doctor, "you can keep him alive&mdash;she
will come&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The agony was long, very long and the wife did not
come. She sent for her again. What could be the
matter?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On seeing her dear dead, an ineffable sadness engrossed
her and big, silent tears fell from her eyes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>An attendant approached her&mdash;she turned her head
and wiped her eyes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Someone there to see your wounded, madame&mdash;"
said the man who did not know&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Paralyzed, fixed to the floor, she could not move.
She saw coming toward her, shrouded in an impressive
silence, a woman&mdash;one of those women of France, good
mother, good wife, good patriot, accustomed from
youth to go through a harsh and bitter life as the wife
of a laboring man, with serenity&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She went straight to him. The nurse followed her
with her glance. She could no longer see her face, but
saw the woman bend a great while over her dead. Of
what was she thinking? Of the Calvary of her man,
of his wound, of his agony, or rather of her own sadness,
or the children for whom she would have to
struggle&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She turned and, coming toward her:</p>

<p>"Is it you, madame, who have cared for him? Permit
me to kiss you."</p>

<p>It was the nurse who wept&mdash;&mdash;</p>

THE IRREVERENT POILU.<br />

<p>An élite Division was <i>au repos</i><a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> in a pretty little village
on the Meuse where the houses are gray and from
where one can hear the cannon at Verdun, like a spring
thunderstorm.</p>

<p>General Pétain has gone to spend a few hours with
these heroes, accompanied by my worthy comrade de
Buisseret.</p>

<p>The brave <i>poilus</i> do not permit themselves the
pleasures of complete inactivity. Whatever spot they
may find themselves in, they organize and "dig themselves
in" as if they must remain for the rest of their
lives!</p>

<p>A <i>poilu</i> is working arduously over a little board hut.
He has running around him two of his "loves," small
pigs, plump and rosy. It is understood they will be
eaten, but not before the squad finds them completely
"<i>à point</i>."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> While waiting it is necessary to keep them
in a shelter and our <i>poilu</i> will quickly finish the sumptuous
dwelling for his favorites.</p>

<p>My comrade, busy looking around while awaiting
the general, becomes interested in the conscientious
labors of the man&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is it for them you are working?"</p>

<p>"Yes, captain, I am making them a wonderful P.C."</p>

THE GENDARMES' SOUP.<br />

</div>

<p>I return from Fort Douaumont and am worn out.
An automobile is coming to meet me at Galavaude
Bridge and I am waiting for it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The gendarmes guarding the approaches to the
bridge notice that I am fatigued. They approach me,
asking if I would not like to sit down.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>
<p>"Did not someone ask you if Captain Capart had
returned?"</p>

<p>"No, captain. Wouldn't you like to come in our
home where it will be more agreeable than in the road?"</p>

<p>I entered the home of the gendarmes. On the table,
which had been set, several covers had been laid with
infinite care. A pot of steaming soup simmered over
a smouldering fire&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;soup!" I cried, sniffing the air&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"If we dared, captain, we would be happy, very
happy, if you would ask for a plate&mdash;or better&mdash;two
plates&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>On saying these words, he lifted the lid of the kettle
on the fire; then with a ladle filled the soup plate full
to the brim&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The soup was excellent!</p>

<p>Since that day, I always regard <i>les cognes</i><a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> with

MOMENTS OF WEAKNESS.<br />
<i>April</i> 17, 1917.<br />
</div>

<p>What bad luck!</p>

<p>Every time an attack is planned it must rain. One
must paddle along in the mud&mdash;and then the water runs
down your neck&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>As we will start before daybreak over the top, one,
naturally, will stumble&mdash;we collect all kinds of sticks so
that we may scrape the mud from our sleeves&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I find myself leaping over the first German lines&mdash;then,
the wide open space before reaching the second
position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Our artillery has done good work, the wire entanglements
are fortunately destroyed.</p>

<p>We leap over more trenches and <i>boyaux</i>&mdash;From time
to time our glance is arrested by German corpses
around which occasionally some of our own have
fallen&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Bullets sing in every direction&mdash;machine-gun nests
we have passed sputter at us from behind.</p>

<p>We go ahead without hesitation, but without speaking&mdash;one
never speaks during these moments!</p>

<p>The field inclines and it is necessary to stop and
pant a few instants&mdash;a circular view&mdash;prisoners hastily
descend the hill, their arms raised, staggering like
drunken men&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It is a nasty place to tarry any length of time&mdash;two
boche machine-guns sixty yards to our right spit
at us. Our advance can be effected, luckily, thanks
to the deep craters our guns have made the preceding
days. Day has fully broken&mdash;a fine rain is falling&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The position is as unmanageable as a runaway horse.
We gain the second objective. The trench is wider than
the former one and I cannot jump over it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It is necessary to descend into the trench. I am
followed by a few companions&mdash;A young German <i>blessé</i>
is stretched out in the bottom. He is extremely young.
He has curly hair and so blond that he looks like a
little child&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He has been thrown in a jumble and the partially
demolished trench on top&mdash;his head is twisted and his
body and legs are sticking up in the air&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>He makes an effort to rise. Striding over him, I see
bloody froth on his lips&mdash;I heard him murmur:</p>

<p>"<i>Wasser</i>, <i>wasser</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>With his arms and shoulders he makes another effort
to get up&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>One after the other we pass over the wounded boy,
careful not to step on him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The attack progresses, but I have the vision of this
child continually before my eyes. I replace my revolver
in the holster, and with blows of my cane I stop a
crowd of prisoners we have just taken, who attempt
to flee, throwing down their rifles as they go&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>We have attained our last objective. Without losing
an instant, we begin to organize it and get ourselves
settled. At the end of a few minutes, officers and
<i>poilus</i> commence to feel the reaction of what we have
just passed through.</p>

<p>Everyone talks at once. We comment on the missing
ones. There are several versions on the death of the
friends we have seen fall&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>For example, several had seen the little boche. Many
remarked about his youth and his childish face&mdash;he yet
breathed&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some hours later, I could not resist&mdash;I made my
way back two miles to see if he still lived&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I found without difficulty the path which will forever
remain solemn in my memory. From a distance I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the trench and the indentation at the foot of which I
was sure of finding him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He is dead! He has not changed his position, but
his face is waxen. His two arms are extended with
fists clenched toward the heaven he has without doubt
cursed!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After having contemplated the dead boy, I retrace
my route, with lowered head, to find my companions&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I had not gone fifty steps before I met, face to face,
one of my comrades of the attack that morning&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What are you doing here&mdash;you, too?"</p>

<p>"I come to help him out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He is dead&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let's go back."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is night. What quiet after that terrible day of
battle. Glorious day!</p>

<p>We are quartered in the German shelters&mdash;use whatever
we can find to build a fire&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It continues to rain outside. We have formed a circle
and discuss the events which have just passed endlessly.</p>

<p>In a corner of the shelter several men, lying full
length on the floor, speak in a low voice. They are
the colonel's messengers. I hear one who says to the
other:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"I went back to see him&mdash;he was dead. I will reproach
myself the rest of my life for not having helped
him up this morning when we jumped over him."</p>

move; he suffered very much&mdash;his lips dry and he had
a tremendous thirst.</p>

<p>Then he felt himself being moved&mdash;he recalled
vaguely having heard the murmur of a voice&mdash;some
jolting, sharp pains which hurt.</p>

<p>A stop! He heard guttural voices, a bright light
passed several times before his eyes which he could not
open&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Another shifting&mdash;a rapid journey and many bumps
and joltings&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When he again regained consciousness he found himself
in a bed and looked to the right and to the left
to find out where he was. He was in a large room
and perceived numerous other beds like his own.</p>

<p>He could twist his head, but his body was fixed, immobile,
and his two arms hurt him terribly.</p>

<p>He saw approaching the bed a man very big and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
strong, with gray hair, gowned in white, accompanied
by two assistants and a nurse.</p>

<p>The doctor gave several orders in German. Little
did it matter to Jean being a prisoner, but his suffering
was horrible. The doctor began unwinding the bandages
to examine the wounds. Soon he was not conscious
of what was going on. They placed a white
napkin over his face and he inhaled the strong odor
of ether. For some moments it seemed to him cannon
were booming in the distance and a loud whistling in
his ears, then nothing more&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Some hours later he came to himself for the second
time and found that his bed was bound and wrapped
like a mummy. He was so feeble&mdash;so feeble. How long
his sleep had been he did not know.</p>

<p>A nurse on seeing him open his eyes brought him
tea and he murmured "thanks"; then she cautioned him
in very bad French to lie quiet and not to move.</p>

<p>The horrible nightmare and the fever lasted through
the night and because he steeled himself he would not
cry&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In the morning the doctor came back with the nurses
and demanded in French that he answer some questions:
he must give his name and the unit to which he belonged.
Then all got black again before his eyes and
the poor devil fainted&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thanks to his strong constitution, he took a turn
for the better, not, however, without passing several
bad days, and the fever left him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>How long was all this going to last? He did not
know&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>So he began to feel better and stronger and rejoiced
when the doctor, in the course of his visits, said to him:</p>

<p>"You're going to pull through, and I'm glad of
it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was still extremely feeble, had to be nourished
with a spoon, but he did not forget that he was very
well taken care of in this hospital.</p>

<p>Turning his head, he perceived with surprise that his
neighbor in the next bed was his comrade in the trenches,
Paul Dubois&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is that you, Patachon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my <i>pauv' vieux</i>."</p>

<p>"Why, you here, too&mdash;what's the matter?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A foot gone&mdash;leg lots shorter&mdash;but I complain no
longer, Cobusse; you don't suffer much any more&mdash;I
thought I heard the death rattle those first days&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I suffer no more&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know how we got here?"</p>

<p>They began reconstructing the scene completely, the
bombardment; and they recalled the premonitory
whistling of the shell that had wounded them both.</p>

<p>They chatted for a long time and there was a consolation
for having been taken prisoner in finding themselves
together.</p>

<p>Some weeks later Cochin and his comrade, being improved
in health and strength, were evacuated to a
hospital in the interior. They made a long journey on
the railroad and perceived more and more how unfortunate
it was to lose one or more limbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>On arriving there, Cochin had so lost the notions
of equilibrium that he fell several times to the ground
to the great despair of Dubois, who thereafter never
slackened his hold on him.</p>

<p>Cobusse and Patachon came rapidly to be very close
friends; these two wrecks of the war could not be
separated and found in each other a reciprocal sustenance.</p>

<p>Patachon washed, dressed and fed Cobusse and rolled
his cigarettes. He tried to explain to his friend that
one can go through life without arms and used such
unusual arguments that it caused his comrade to smile
at times.</p>

<p>And the latter said amusingly:</p>

<p>"In the meantime, I have an itching&mdash;scratch then,
my head&mdash;not there!&mdash;yes, there, how good that feels,
Patachon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Their morale remained excellent and they were confident
of victory.</p>

<p>During their captivity, one rainy day, they were sitting
side by side on a bunk and began to talk of their
families.</p>

<p>Cochin told how his wife was waiting for him in
<i>Panam</i><a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> with their little Hélène, who was almost
five. He could not stop talking of the little <i>gamine</i>
who was "his own picture."</p>

<p>"You cannot realize, Patachon, how lively and intelligent
she is. Ah! what wouldn't I give to clasp her
in my arms."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>
<p>To change the conversation Patachon said to him:</p>

<p>"Some time you'll be eager to scratch yourself,
Cobusse&mdash;Don't stand on ceremony, you know I'm here
for <i>that</i>, my old friend&mdash;we must aid each other in
life."</p>

<p>The long hours of captivity passed sordidly enough,
broken by the arrival of letters from France and packages
of food.</p>

<p>When they talked with the Germans they were completely
reassured on the outcome of the war: both of
them were very skeptical when they heard the bells ringing
and when they read the bulletins announcing another
German victory. When their guardians looked
gloomy Patachon never failed to smile at Cobusee.</p>

<p>"Our overseer wears a long face these great days,
he must again have swallowed another pill!"</p>

<p>The two, and their comrades, shattered wrecks like
themselves, always passed the sombre days in the little
German village where they were taken. They had to
suffer numerous privations. They missed the hospital
at the front and the German doctor who was "rather
a good sort."</p>

<p>They had to take insults from these heartless people
and many times they were able to read a secret joy in
their eyes on seeing them crippled.</p>

<p>"Ough! the dirty beasts, Cobusse, did you see how
that woman there sneered at us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Many months went by and Cochin and Dubois never
left each other. They spoke less of the war, but retained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the hope of returning to France and of this they
often talked.</p>

<p>"Listen, Patachon, here we are, you and I, <i>grands
blessés</i>, and we should have been in Paris long ago&mdash;what
are they trying to do&mdash;keeping us all this time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Cobusse, it commences to be very long&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>One day, however, it was announced their turn had
come and they could leave. At the thought of seeing
France again they were thrilled. They had done their
duty and could return home proud&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Quickly they were ready and began the long journey
across Germany. Their train was full of <i>grands blessés</i>,
miserable beings which the grave did not want and
which it was glad to be free of. As Patachon said,
"They all look like a lot of wire and rubber&mdash;&mdash;"
They were blind, sick, maimed and mad!</p>

<p>There was enough misery in that train, but all were
haughty and dignified!</p>

<p>"What a sad air," said Cochin, "this boche country
has&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rolling along thus during one entire day, the night
was broken by very long stops that seemed endless.
And these long hours of waiting made them very tired
and low spirited; as soon as they started again everyone
began to laugh and talk.</p>

<p>As they drew near to the Swiss frontier scarcely
could they conceal the joy they felt on leaving this
country that was killing them.</p>

<p>At dawn the train arrived at a station all lit up,
where, in spite of the early hour, there were great
throngs. It is Schaffhouse!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Along the platform Swiss officers and soldiers went
to and fro, excited as if they saw Frenchmen for the
first time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are in Switzerland, Patachon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>They looked out the car window and scarcely had
time to see, on the other track, a trainload of wounded
Germans going the other way.</p>

<p>"You see, they are maimed like us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The soldiers in the two trains regarded each other
closely without a word.</p>

<p>Hardly had the train of the German <i>grands blessés</i>
started to leave the station than a military band began
to play the "Marseillaise"!</p>

<p>Yes, the "Marseillaise"&mdash;They raised their heads and
there wasn't a one who did not hold himself in an effort
not to cry&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then the station became crowded with persons who
wished to see the <i>grands blessés</i>. They distribute
flowers, cigarettes, little tri-colored flags, small cakes,
chocolate, colored postal cards&mdash;The station gets
more and more crowded and the excitement grows.</p>

<p>"Ah! we are not in that boche country any more,
Patachon&mdash;I begin to breathe easier already&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But they're all more or less amazed at this great
bustle to which they are ill-accustomed, and for the
first time they see human beings who have sincere pity
for their misery.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At Zurich, at Olten and at Berne, they see the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
things and more so as they approach France. Here,
the manifestations are clamorous and very lively.
Above all, the people speak French and shout: "<i>Bravo
les braves!</i>"</p>

<p>However, they are not yet completely happy: they
are not home! But they stretch and become more attentive
to the surrounding country. Through the window
they admire the Bernoise Alps blanketed with
snow.</p>

<p>At Fribourg, a woman holds out a bouquet of flowers
to Cochin, while her daughter presents him at the same
time with a cup of steaming bouillon. They cannot
understand why the crowd shouts so much. They cry
also: "<i>Vive la France!</i>"</p>

<p>"Take it," say both the mother and daughter.</p>

<p>Patachon leans out the window.</p>

<p>"He cannot take them," he says, "because his arms
are gone&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The two step back as if to shrink away from this
immense misfortune, but Patachon calls to them:</p>

<p>"Pass me the flowers and the cup&mdash;it is I who am
his mother at present. Thank you, madame; thank
you, <i>ma petite</i>&mdash;<i>Allons</i>, drink that, old brother. Is
it too hot?"</p>

<p>The mother and child begin to cry, "Oh, the poor,
the poor <i>blessé</i>."</p>

<p>Cochin stiffens as if proud of his wound&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They passed by Lausanne, and Geneva, and at the
latter place said adieux to Switzerland. It was night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
when they crossed the border and a half hour later
entered the station at Bellegrade&mdash;France!</p>

<p>At last they were home. The people were different.
Nurses went up and down the platform with a cheery
word for everyone. In short, each one wanted to tell
his story, but a smile from these women almost made
them forget it.</p>

<p>The following day they got out at the Lyon station
where a beautiful ceremony had been planned to receive
them. The mayor addressed them in front of the station
and at his side were the general commanding the
district and the city officials. Little girls, quaintly
dressed in their first communicant costumes, distributed
flowers, and Patachon fixed a pretty rosebud in his
comrade's tunic.</p>

<p>The mayor compared them to old flags riddled with
bullets, at which one gazed with pride and emotion.
Everyone was grave, because they were conscious it was
true.</p>

<p>The music kept on playing&mdash;the throng went wild&mdash;was
this not a beautiful dream after that horrible nightmare?
The blind themselves smiled, as if they saw&mdash;They
breathed the air of France!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They went back into the train, this time to complete
the last step of their journey: to-morrow they will be
in Paris.</p>

<p>They are tired and they find the time passes slowly,
so great is their impatience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Cochin telegraphs his wife to be at the station with
the little one&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>They cannot sleep and they speak of their captivity.
They are content within themselves as long as they do
not give way to discouragement. They fully apprehend
now the return&mdash;what will become of them?</p>

<p>They await the coming of day with disquietude.
Night seems without an end. At last, the sun routs
the darkness and they recognize the outskirts of
Paris&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>At seven o'clock in the morning their train enters
the station&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"The war is finished for us, Cobusse, and we are lucky
to get back&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cochin does not reply. He looks out the window and
sees the station crowded with people&mdash;they are all talking
at once&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Patachon, I see my wife and Hélène&mdash;Wave
at them!"</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>They have seen him and begin waving their hands,
at the same time making signs for him to come down on
the platform. Patachon shouts out the window:</p>

<p>"We're coming!"</p>

<p>Cochin, very pale, leaves the coach, assisted by two
nurses. He is some steps in front of his wife, who
is holding Hélène. He walks ahead rapidly as if
to take her in his arms, and then understands. He
stops&mdash;and falls back, sobbing on the shoulder of his
friend&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come&mdash;come, my <i>pauv' vieux</i>, don't cry&mdash;what's
this&mdash;you who never cry!"</p>

<p>"Patachon&mdash;I can&mdash;I can never clasp her in my
arms&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What a sad air you have&mdash;an infinite sadness&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I believe no longer in GOD, nor the love of a woman,
nor in the friendship of a friend&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You believe then, no longer in anything?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
